CCT1	This article presents a regressive-iterative approach for reconstructing historical landscapes using a geographical information system (GIS). In historical research, regressive methods moving step-by-step back in time from a better known later situation were already applied by #CITATION_TAG (1883) or by Bloch (1931) for the reconstruction of medieval agrarian landscapes in France and have been used since then within historical research (e.g. Forschungsinitiative Umweltgeschichte 1999). The method presented here takes a similar approach. In this study, we integrated three types of evidence: (1) numerous historical sources, both textual and cartographic, (2) analysis of fluvial processes that were typical for the Austrian Danube before regulation, and (3) assessment of river engineering measures of the past with regard to their effectiveness and their impact on river behaviour. This approach constitutes a temporally regressive method (in the sense of Marc Bloch), but comprises iterative work steps to refine the results for more recent time situations.	5	This article presents a regressive-iterative approach for reconstructing historical landscapes using a geographical information system (GIS).

CCT2	"The increased threat posed by the Ottoman army and the second siege of Vienna in 1683 gave rise to numerous maps and views that illustrate acts of war. Most of them focus only on the historical city centre or show the riverscape in a generalised manner. The riverine structures were mostly copied from older drawings, which can be identified as sources. Hence, little information about the past configuration of the riverscape can be extracted from the great number of 17th/18th century maps and illustrations. The most important exception is a map designed by Colonel Giuseppe Baron Priami in 1663 for the improvement of Vienna""s fortifications. It can be considered as the first map of the Viennese riverscape, which is depicted in a geographically largely correct manner (Mohilla and Michlmayr 1996;Opll 2004). 9 Even more interesting are several river regulation plans that were drawn after the siege from 1686 onwards, in particular the famous work of the Italian cartographer Leander Anguissola from 1688 and a newly found map by Hoffmann von Anckherskron et al. dating from 1700. Compared to older plans and maps, both maps show large areas of the Viennese riverscape in a regular map projection. Problems remain: In Anguissola""s map, the differentiation between planned and existing hydraulic structures is not always clear and the map was modified at a later date to adapt it to the changed conditions of the riverscape. For example, a new cut-off channel at the Donaukanal excavated in 1700-1703 and bridges built in 1704 were later added, so it could serve as the basis for proposed hydraulic constructions in 1712 (#CITATION_TAG 1977). 11 The map from Hoffmann von Anckherskron et al. (1700) can be considered as the oldest Viennese river engineering map with a high degree of position accuracy and an outstanding level of detail. It was produced as a planning basis for the construction of a new course for the upper Donaukanal and so far it has never been described in the historical literature. It even shows minor relicts of past hydraulic structures below the low water level and several transects through the river arms. The map provides a sound reference for the localisation of hydraulic structures built in the late 17th century of which-until now-we only partly knew about from written sources."	0	"9 Even more interesting are several river regulation plans that were drawn after the siege from 1686 onwards, in particular the famous work of the Italian cartographer Leander Anguissola from 1688 and a newly found map by Hoffmann von Anckherskron et al. dating from 1700.

CCT4	"The most important source is provided by Schmeltzl (1548), who documented the length of each bridge by counting the steps needed for crossing the bridge and the numbers of bridge pillars in 1547. He additionally noted the approximate distance between the outer and the inner main bridges. Bonifatius Wolmuet produced a map of the city of Vienna in the same year, for which he measured the length of the inner bridge (Schlagbrücke). 22 alculating Schmeltzl""s mean step length based on Wolmuet""s bridge length allows the lengths of the main bridges in 1547 to be calculated (for more details on the history of the Viennese bridges see Sonnlechner et al. 2013, in this issue). Since bridge length refers to bankfull width of a channel, which in Vienna coincides approximately with the 1-year flood, it provides a good measure for the discharge capacity of river channels. According to the """"hydraulic geometry"""" approach introduced by #CITATION_TAG and Maddock (1953), channel forms respond to changes in the flow regime. Bridge lengths beyond the range of widths typical for the Austrian Danube point either to inaccuracies in the cartographic sources or to amplified morphological turnover due to short-term channel shiftings (as happened in Vienna around 1565)."	0	"Bonifatius Wolmuet produced a map of the city of Vienna in the same year, for which he measured the length of the inner bridge (Schlagbrücke). 22 alculating Schmeltzl""s mean step length based on Wolmuet""s bridge length allows the lengths of the main bridges in 1547 to be calculated (for more details on the history of the Viennese bridges see Sonnlechner et al. 2013, in this issue).

CCT5	"The aim to """"reconstruct"""" the historical development of a river landscape true-to-life is a priori doomed to fail. The preserved information is too fragmentary; the available sources are too different in type and content. Some sources are more resistant to the reconstruction of past riverscapes than others. Historical sources (maps, plans, documents, etc.) were not created for use in a GIS, they were produced for particular reasons and thus always reflect how the riverscape was perceived. They reflect the interests and motives of their producers and recipients and are therefore only fragments of a historical state. The methodological quest is to determine which fragments can be useful for the reconstruction. The challenge is greater in a landscape that has undergone incessant change, as was the case with the historical Danube near Vienna. It has to be borne in mind that all historical relicts from the Danube""s history are sources for the changing perception of that river. Historians ask for the motivation and interests that were important in the making, using and keeping of their sources (#CITATION_TAG 1993). Approaching a source from an environmental history viewpoint means interpreting it both as an expression of changing biophysical relations to the environment and of changing cultural attitudes, ideas and ideals about nature. Interpreting it requires integrative methods including source critique. An interdisciplinary team""s different perspectives are helpful in this endeavour. So our project team included historians from the Centre for Environmental History Vienna (Alpen-Adria University Klagenfurt) and the Municipal and Provincial Archives of Vienna, and fluvial morphologists from the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU)."	0	"The methodological quest is to determine which fragments can be useful for the reconstruction.

CCT7	Reconstructing riverscapes over decades or even centuries better approximates the former situations than the reconstruction of a single point in time. In recent years, GISbased studies of historical fluvial morphology were conducted over the long term to reveal the causes of past channel changes and floodplain degradation (Gurnell et al. 1994(Gurnell et al. , 2005Marston et al. 1995;Kiss et al. 2008). Some historical studies specifically focus on the spatial distribution of riverine habitats and the land cover of riverscapes. In Europe, such investigations were conducted on several French rivers (e.g. Girel et al. 1997;Kondolf et al. 2007), the current Slovak Danube (Pisút 2002), the lower Rhine (Schoor et al. 1999;Wolfert 2001), the Dyje River, Czech Republic (Skokanova 2008) and on several English rivers (Lewin 2010). Outside Europe, comparable studies exist for e.g. the upper Mississippi (de Jager et al. 2011) and the Sacramento River, California (Greco et al. 2007). In ecology and environmental history alike, GIS techniques have often been deployed to reconstruct past land cover and land use changes based on historical maps such as cadastral maps. These include, amongst others, the Baltimore-Chesapeake region (#CITATION_TAG et al. 1997), the American Great Plains (Cunfer 2008), the Rocky Mountains (Aspinall 2004), Southern Germany (Bender et al. 2005;Schuppert and Dix 2009), the Tisza River in Hungary (Hegedüs and Duray 2009) and several Austrian villages and rivers (Forschungsinitiative Umweltgeschichte 1999;Haidvogl 2008).

CCT10	"In the first half of the 18th century, the number of topographical sources substantially increased, and from the late 18th century a great variety of different types are available. At that time, topographical views and maps produced for commercial purposes gained 8 Except for Slezak (1980), who came to the same conclusion. considerable public attention. Several of these maps were created on the basis of the wellknown city map from Leander Anguissola and Johann Jacob Marinoni in 1704 and published under the title """"Accuratissima Viennae Austriae Ichnographica Delineatio"""" (""""Most accurate plan of Vienna in Austria"""") in 1706. 12 True to its title, the plan shows the city with its fortifications and with the growing suburbs, which at that time had already spread into the riverine landscape-namely the Leopoldstadt on the large island confined by the Danube and the Donaukanal (here called the Neuer Canal; #CITATION_TAG et al. 2013, in this issue). In this plan the Danube itself is at least as important as the urban settlement. The main contemporary intention of the plan was to show the newly strengthened fortifications of the Habsburg residence. An additional second ring of fortification walls and ramparts (called the Linienwall) had been built in 1704 to better protect the residence. This plan makes clear that the Danube was an essential part of the city""s fortification system. To the northeast, the Danube was Vienna""s fortification. In the floodplain, only parts of the Leopoldstadt and the head of the only bridge crossing the main arm of the Danube were fortified with man-made structures. In later editions of the map up to c. 1785, only the settlement areas within the town were updated; the riverscape was depicted as unchanged, a pretence that the riverscape had been stable over decades. However, the comparison with the famous """"Jagdatlas Kaiser Karls VI. (""""Atlas of imperial hunting grounds"""") produced by J. J. Marinoni between 1726 and 1729 reveals that the riverscape had experienced substantial alterations since 1704. 13 This map series is the first geometrically coherent cartographic source that also covers areas remote from the historical city centre (Marinoni 1751). 14 n the 18th century, the growth of the city also gave rise to new regulation projects. Thus hundreds of hydraulic construction plans were generated, but many show constructions never implemented. Numerous of these plans were compiled by the hydraulic engineer Johann Sigismund Hubert, who constructed the first larger flood protection scheme for Vienna. Since most plans only refer to minor regulation works, many of them have never been described in the literature. In this case, only the comparative analysis of the numerous plans with written sources can help clarify which works were actually realised."	2	"At that time, topographical views and maps produced for commercial purposes gained 8 Except for Slezak (1980), who came to the same conclusion. considerable public attention.

CCT11	"Taken together, the various historical sources document a major rearrangement of the Danube channel network. In order to conclude whether identified fluvial dynamics reflect the river""s typical behaviour rather than an exceptional hydromorphological state, climatic changes and related flood regimes also have to be considered (Howard 1996;McCarney-Castle et al. 2011;Macklin et al. 2012). For example, increasing runoff generally leads to channel straightening and profile widening. Together with augmented sediment loads, it additionally fosters the transformation from meandering to braiding (Nanson and Knighton 1996;Marti and Bezzola 2004). The major channel shifts at the Viennese Danube therefore have to be interpreted against the background of the Grindelwald Fluctuation, the first extreme phase of the Little Ice Age from the 1560s to the 1620s (Pfister 1980(Pfister , 2007#CITATION_TAG 1999;Hohensinner et al. 2013, in this issue).

CCT13	Due to the different forms of channel adjustments and floodplain inundation-active overflow, backwater flooding, or seepage inundation-such floodplains featured a great variety of depositional processes. Lateral point-bar accretion, overbank vertical-deposition, braid-channel accretion in wider profiles and abandoned channel accretion were most typical. The different processes are associated with specific sediment fractions. Annual erosion rates ranged from 1.6 % of the floodplain terrain in the Lobau directly downstream from Vienna to 2.5 % in the more dynamic Danube sections such as the Machland, 160 km upstream from Vienna (#CITATION_TAG and Jungwirth 2009). Within a few decades, large shares of the floodplain terrain were renewed. Accordingly, high shares of morphologically young terrain were typical.	2	Due to the different forms of channel adjustments and floodplain inundation-active overflow, backwater flooding, or seepage inundation-such floodplains featured a great variety of depositional processes.

For the quantification of intrarater and inter-rater reproducibility of TP examination, two types of analysis were applied: the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the Bland-Altman method for assessing agreement. 25 26 CC provides information on the ability to differentiate between the variation between subjects and measurement variation. The ICC was defined as the ratio of variance among patients (subject variability) over the total variance (subject variability, observer variability and measurement variability). ICC ranges between 0 (no reliability) and 1 ( perfect reliability), and values of ICCs are excellent when >0.75 and poor when <0.40. Results between these ranges represent moderate-to-good reliability. 27 According to another reference, ICC >0.7 is considered good. 25 he Bland-Altman method provides insight into the distribution of differences in relation to mean values. #CITATION_TAG greement was quantified by calculating the mean difference between two sets of observations and the SD for this difference. The closer the mean difference was to 0 and the smaller the SD of this difference, the better was the agreement. The differences were depicted in relation to the mean values. The 95% limits of agreement were defined as the mean difference between the raters ±1.96 × SD of the difference . Furthermore, agreement within ±1 TPs and ±3 TPs was calculated.	5	Results between these ranges represent moderate-to-good reliability. 27 According to another reference, ICC >0.7 is considered good. 25 he Bland-Altman method provides insight into the distribution of differences in relation to mean values. #CITATION_TAG greement was quantified by calculating the mean difference between two sets of observations and the SD for this difference.

CCT15	The present study showed that digital TP examination resulted in total TP counts with acceptable-to-excellent reliability when calibration of the thumbs with a dolorimeter was performed before the testing. This indicated that the measurement error, which was less than 2 TPs, was considerably smaller than the variation between individuals. The lesser experienced Rater B did not perform as well as the more experienced Rater A, and this was especially evident on comparison of the lower limits of the CIs. However, the reliability of Rater B was acceptable, but more training and regular use would probably improve the results. Training has been shown to reduce the variability in applying a kg digital force. 29 greement is independent of the variation between subjects. We consider an agreement of more than 70% as good, and it was found for ±3 TPs in both men and women, indicating that digital TP examination in daily practice may be used, keeping in mind the uncertainty of ±3 TPs. This part of the result was especially important, since we found that TP counts were higher in women than in men, in line with other studies. In the general population, TP counts of more than 10 and 6 have been identified in 10-20% of women and men, respectively. 6 7 Thus, a TP count of 9 may be normal in women, but high in men. The median TP count of 8 was elevated as compared with the median TP count in the general population, which is between 3 and 6 TPs. 6 Previously, it has been shown that TP counts were elevated in regional pain conditions as compared with pain-free controls, but lower than in fibromyalgia. #CITATION_TAG owever, SDD ranged from 4 to 6, indicating less precision of TP examination than reliability. Thus, according to the present study, TP examination may result in TP counts that may differentiate between high, intermediate or low levels, but not between different levels in the low or high range. Moreover, TP examination-as used in the present study-would not be sufficiently precise to differentiate between patients with higher or lower TP counts than 10/11 TPs such as are used in the diagnosis of fibromyalgia.	1	6 7 Thus, a TP count of 9 may be normal in women, but high in men.

CCT20	Social animals make collective decisions between available options, particularly about where the group spends its time. When making a shared collective decision, a group faces the challenges of integrating information from multiple individuals and managing the different decision-preferences of group members [11]. Such decisions are influenced by individual information, conflicts of interest and time-constraints [12,13]. To understand how a collective decision is reached, the rules followed by contributing members of the group must be identified [14]. Emigrating social insects are a good model system for the study of collective decisionmaking, because all members share the aim of coming to a consensus about a new, good nest site as soon as possible, but the information about available site quality is distributed very unevenly within the colony [15,#CITATION_TAG]. To investigate the mechanism of decision making, we used models of, and experiments on, emigrating cavity-nesting rock ants, Temnothorax albipennis.	2	When making a shared collective decision, a group faces the challenges of integrating information from multiple individuals and managing the different decision-preferences of group members [11].

CCT21	"Animals need to make choices between multiple available options at many stages in their life histories, such as during mate selection, foraging, or when deciding where to shelter or to build a nest. The fitness benefits of choosing the best option mean that decision-making strategies will be subject to natural selection. Multiple comparison or ""best of n"" strategies perform most accurately, and are likely to be optimal when searching and sampling costs are low, e.g. on a lek [1,2] and when long-term fitness implications of the decision are high, e.g. in home range selection [3].

CCT23	The second previously-proposed mechanism, quality dependent recruitment latencies, is an attractive idea -it does not rely on comparisons, and self-organised decisions can emerge because ants finding a poor nest delay before recruiting, effectively giving others that have found a good nest a head-start in the recruitment process. The initial advantage is amplified by recruitment, and this can be shown to be sufficient to account for collective choice [24]. In both the threshold rule and the recruitment latency hypothesis, a scout makes a probabilistic, quality-dependent decision about whether to recruit each time she visits a nest. The difference between these mechanisms come from the assumptions made about what the scout does after leaving the nest, and how this results in a colony decision-mechanism. In our threshold rule, the ant either commits or continues searching. In the recruitment latency hypothesis, ants which do not immediately start recruiting may subsequently recruit, with a quality-dependent latency. In the original formulation of this idea [20] it is mentioned that ants might discover other nests during this latent period, but it is not suggested that the latency is actually a result of the search for other nests. Searching for alternatives has a more prominent role in later versions of the recruitment latency model [24] making it more similar to our threshold model, however, the idea of simple quality-dependent recruitment latencies functioning as a choice mechanism still appears often in discussions of collective decisionmaking [11,38,39]. There are two empirical problems with such a mechanism. Firstly, colonies are able to choose a good nest, even when it is so much further away than a poor nest that travel time should cancel out differences in recruitment latency [27]. Secondly, all empirical evidence for quality-dependent recruitment latencies comes from studies offering a colony just one new nest [20,22,24,28]. When recruitment latencies are measured in multiple nest experiments, no quality-dependent recruitment latencies differences are observed [this study and 26]. We used modelling to investigate these empirical results. Our simulation and analytical results reproduce quality-dependent recruitment latency in a single-nest experiment, but show that the presence of an extra nest disrupts the quality-dependence of the latency to commitment and recruitment (Figs. 5-6). When a single poor nest is offered, acceptance times in the model will be geometrically distributed, with few ants accepting the site early due to rare assessment errors or low individual-thresholds, and the remainder continuing to re-assess the same site until they eventually decide it is good enough. When a second higher quality site is introduced, the same small proportion of ants will accept the poor site early due to low-threshold or assessment error, but the remainder will now tend to discover the alternative, superior site, and recruit to this quickly on average because of its increased quality. The same pattern would be observed for a threshold-rule with direct comparison (see Text S1), and also for a quality-dependent recruitment latency-rule, if it is assumed that ants search for alternatives during the latency period and have a high probability of finding other sites [20]. However, these alternative models are less parsimonious, requiring ants to remember the qualities and/or locations of visited sites and evaluate this in making subsequent comparisons or use the information to decide when and where to start recruiting. These results also clearly demonstrate that a phenomenon observed when only one option is available, cannot be assumed to function in the same way when choosing between multiple options (see also [7]). Another well-studied example of collective decision-making is nest-site choice by swarming honeybees (Apis mellifera). Like ant colonies, bee swarms are able to choose between different nest sites, and individual bees do not need to have visited multiple sites for the swarm to be able to choose between them [40]. However, the way the scouts act on this information differs between the two groups. The ants seem to use a binary decision process to either accept that nest or continue searching. Ants accepting a nest recruit others, causing a positive feedback process, but ant scouts do not modulate their recruitment according to nest quality, e.g. by recruiting at a faster rate or for longer to a higher quality nest [20,26]. In contrast, bees use a graded process, whereby scouts initially discovering a new nest-site almost always recruit [41], but the duration and rate of the recruiting waggle-dances are dependent on nest quality #CITATION_TAG. This means that more recruits are brought to better nest-sites, leading to a positive feedback process usually resulting in a unanimous choice of the better site [42]. One possible reason for this difference in strategy could be differences in nest availability: if suitable honeybee nest sites are relatively rare, then it might be better for scouts to avoid ever rejecting a potential nest outright.	1	However, the way the scouts act on this information differs between the two groups.

CCT25	"Direct comparison of alternatives is seen in a range of animals and contexts, including foraging in scrub jays and humans [8,52], mate choice in bower-birds and dance-flies [53,#CITATION_TAG] and shell assessment by hermit crabs [55]. A best-of-n comparison strategy would maximise decision accuracy [2], so why do neither individual bees nor ants appear to use this strategy when foraging or choosing a new home? One possibility is that multiple comparisons are too cognitively complex for ant and bee brains. However, small insects including bees are competent at related cognitive processes, including contextual learning, discrimination between stimuli and associative recall [56]. Male dance-flies compare the size of potential mates before choosing [54], and there is evidence to suggest that honeybee workers are capable of comparative evaluation of flowers [57] and that lone T. rugatulus ant workers are capable of comparing the attributes of nest-sites which are very close together [25]. There may, therefore, be reasons other than cognitive constraints for why relying on individual best-of-n comparisons to inform collective choices does not appear to have evolved as a decision mechanism in bees or ants. One possible reason is that during their evolutionary history the ants have typically been faced with decisions about whether to accept a single option at a time, rather than simultaneously having information about multiple options, and this has shaped the evolution of their decision process [7]. Another possible reason is the potential speed advantage of avoiding a sampling period. Sampling periods can be costly [2,7] and pose the mathematically complex problem of deciding how long to sample for before starting the decision process [58]. Avoiding best-of-n comparisons allows a potentially vulnerable colony to select the first nest encountered, if it is good enough. Perhaps even more important is distributing the decision-making process, relying less on information-processing by a single individual; rather allowing the decision to emerge from a collective process to which even partly-informed individuals can contribute. In this colony-level cognition, the relevant information about the environment is represented within the individuals in a colony, their actions and interactions. At the collective level this generates new information: which nest the colony should choose [59]. In both bees and ants, the information held by individuals is integrated into a colony choice by means of a quorum threshold, which triggers rapid implementation of the decision [18,60]. Although the colony will usually choose the site which reaches quorum first, this does not mean that the colony as a whole must ""satisfice accepting the first nest surpassing some minimum standard. Using quality-dependent initiation (in Temnothorax ants) or modulation (in honeybees) of the recruitment process leading to the attainment of a quorum, the colony in effect carries out a concurrent but indirect collective comparison process, which may implement optimal decision-making through the actions of partly-informed individuals [61]. This ensures that the nest to reach a quorum first is also likely to be the best option, even when there is an array of possible alternatives [16,42]. Thus without the individuals using a ""best-of-n"" comparison strategy, the colony is able to solve a ""best-of-n"" challenge [16,62]."	1	Direct comparison of alternatives is seen in a range of animals and contexts, including foraging in scrub jays and humans [8,52], mate choice in bower-birds and dance-flies [53,#CITATION_TAG] and shell assessment by hermit crabs [55]. A best-of-n comparison strategy would maximise decision accuracy [2], so why do neither individual bees nor ants appear to use this strategy when foraging or choosing a new home? One possibility is that multiple comparisons are too cognitively complex for ant and bee brains. However, small insects including bees are competent at related cognitive processes, including contextual learning, discrimination between stimuli and associative recall [56].	D
CCT26	"First, ants could use a comparison strategy, in which ants that have visited both nests would compare their qualities and recruit nestmates only to the better one [20]. Second, ants visiting just one nest could determine how long they hesitate before recruiting nestmates (recruitment latency) based on the nest quality [20]. A combination of these two mechanisms has been used as the basis of several decision models [18,[21][22][23][24]. Although lone T. rugatulus ant workers are capable of comparing the attributes of nest-sites which are very close together [25], the evidence for individual ants making direct comparisons between nests during colony emigration is weak [26], and furthermore, ant colonies are able to choose a distant good nest over a nearby poor nest, when recruitment latency differences would be expected to be cancelled out by travel time (Fig. 1a) [26,27]. The third possible mechanism of choice is a sequential search strategy, based on a very simple rule of thumb, a ""threshold rule by which an ant assesses a nest against her own fixed quality threshold, and either accepts the nest and begins recruitment, or rejects it and continues searching [26]. Qualitydependent recruitment latency has been demonstrated empirically only when colonies were presented with a single new nest and were not required to make a choice [20,22,24,#CITATION_TAG]. Robinson et al. [26] hypothesized that these apparent recruitment latency effects could emerge as a by-product of a threshold rule, because ants that find a low-quality nest will tend to reject it and continue searching, whereas ants that find a high quality nest will tend to accept it and begin recruitment. In addition, Robinson et al. [26] hypothesized that the apparent comparison phenomenon in which ants that have visited equidistant poor and good nests usually recruit only to the good nest (Fig. 1b; [20]) can be explained more parsimoniously with a threshold rule in which the poor nest is rejected and forgotten, then the good nest is discovered and accepted, rather than requiring individual ants to perform the more cognitively complex task of remembering and comparing the qualities of different nests. We aim to test the hypothesis that this simple parsimonious mechanism (the threshold rule) is sufficient to reproduce observed empirical patterns of collective decision-making."	0	"A combination of these two mechanisms has been used as the basis of several decision models [18,[21][22][23][24].

This clearly shows that empirical data of this sort cannot be used as evidence that an animal is really remembering and comparing. The decision process we propose is ""memoryless"" in the sense that individual ants do not have to remember previously visited alternatives during their search for an acceptable nest. Our model deals only with the decision process up to the point at which an ant accepts a nest. After that point, real ants clearly do use memory of nest location in order to recruit nest-mates to that nest by tandemrunning [20]. Recruitment is the most easily identifiable action indicating commitment, but ants that have accepted a nest may also act on their commitment by making repeat visits to the nest [26,#CITATION_TAG].

CCT42	"Collective decisions are also made in other contexts, such as choice of foraging site. Here again, comparisons of sites by individuals seems to play little role.

CCT43	The second previously-proposed mechanism, quality dependent recruitment latencies, is an attractive idea -it does not rely on comparisons, and self-organised decisions can emerge because ants finding a poor nest delay before recruiting, effectively giving others that have found a good nest a head-start in the recruitment process. The initial advantage is amplified by recruitment, and this can be shown to be sufficient to account for collective choice [24]. In both the threshold rule and the recruitment latency hypothesis, a scout makes a probabilistic, quality-dependent decision about whether to recruit each time she visits a nest. The difference between these mechanisms come from the assumptions made about what the scout does after leaving the nest, and how this results in a colony decision-mechanism. In our threshold rule, the ant either commits or continues searching. In the recruitment latency hypothesis, ants which do not immediately start recruiting may subsequently recruit, with a quality-dependent latency. In the original formulation of this idea [20] it is mentioned that ants might discover other nests during this latent period, but it is not suggested that the latency is actually a result of the search for other nests. Searching for alternatives has a more prominent role in later versions of the recruitment latency model [24] making it more similar to our threshold model, however, the idea of simple quality-dependent recruitment latencies functioning as a choice mechanism still appears often in discussions of collective decisionmaking [11,#CITATION_TAG,39]. There are two empirical problems with such a mechanism. Firstly, colonies are able to choose a good nest, even when it is so much further away than a poor nest that travel time should cancel out differences in recruitment latency [27]. Secondly, all empirical evidence for quality-dependent recruitment latencies comes from studies offering a colony just one new nest [20,22,24,28]. When recruitment latencies are measured in multiple nest experiments, no quality-dependent recruitment latencies differences are observed [this study and 26]. We used modelling to investigate these empirical results. Our simulation and analytical results reproduce quality-dependent recruitment latency in a single-nest experiment, but show that the presence of an extra nest disrupts the quality-dependence of the latency to commitment and recruitment (Figs. 5-6). When a single poor nest is offered, acceptance times in the model will be geometrically distributed, with few ants accepting the site early due to rare assessment errors or low individual-thresholds, and the remainder continuing to re-assess the same site until they eventually decide it is good enough. When a second higher quality site is introduced, the same small proportion of ants will accept the poor site early due to low-threshold or assessment error, but the remainder will now tend to discover the alternative, superior site, and recruit to this quickly on average because of its increased quality. The same pattern would be observed for a threshold-rule with direct comparison (see Text S1), and also for a quality-dependent recruitment latency-rule, if it is assumed that ants search for alternatives during the latency period and have a high probability of finding other sites [20]. However, these alternative models are less parsimonious, requiring ants to remember the qualities and/or locations of visited sites and evaluate this in making subsequent comparisons or use the information to decide when and where to start recruiting. These results also clearly demonstrate that a phenomenon observed when only one option is available, cannot be assumed to function in the same way when choosing between multiple options (see also [7]). Another well-studied example of collective decision-making is nest-site choice by swarming honeybees (Apis mellifera). Like ant colonies, bee swarms are able to choose between different nest sites, and individual bees do not need to have visited multiple sites for the swarm to be able to choose between them [40]. However, the way the scouts act on this information differs between the two groups. The ants seem to use a binary decision process to either accept that nest or continue searching. Ants accepting a nest recruit others, causing a positive feedback process, but ant scouts do not modulate their recruitment according to nest quality, e.g. by recruiting at a faster rate or for longer to a higher quality nest [20,26]. In contrast, bees use a graded process, whereby scouts initially discovering a new nest-site almost always recruit [41], but the duration and rate of the recruiting waggle-dances are dependent on nest quality [42]. This means that more recruits are brought to better nest-sites, leading to a positive feedback process usually resulting in a unanimous choice of the better site [42]. One possible reason for this difference in strategy could be differences in nest availability: if suitable honeybee nest sites are relatively rare, then it might be better for scouts to avoid ever rejecting a potential nest outright.	0	In our threshold rule, the ant either commits or continues searching.

CCT46	"Three-New-Nests"" Experiment. Six T. albipennis colonies were collected from the Dorset coast, England, June-July 2009. Colonies were queenright and contained 80-200 workers and brood of all stages. Colonies were housed in artificial nests [27] and provided with water ad libitum and honey solution and Drosophila melanogaster weekly. We used these colonies to investigate decision-making when a colony was offered a choice of three new nests. Six trials were performed, each with a new colony. One day prior to an emigration trial, we attached an RFID microtransponder (50065006120 mm) with a unique ID to the thorax of every worker ant in the colony [32,33] and housed the colony in a nest formed of a hexagonal glass slide (edge length = 30 mm), a 1.5 mm cardboard perimeter (cavity area 1496 mm ) and an acetate lid with a central entrance hole (1.5 mm diameter) to avoid introducing directional bias. We performed trials in a circular arena with Fluon-coated sides, the floor of which was cleaned with water and alcohol between trials. Three new hexagonal nests with the same dimensions as the original nest were placed in the arena (Fig. 1c). Two nests had clear acetate lids and one had a red filter covering the cavity area, making the nest appear relatively dark to the ants #CITATION_TAG. Ant colonies choose dark over light nests [19]. The position of the good nest was interchanged between trials. The new nests had 1.5 mm wide entrances in the side facing the centre of the arena, over which RFID readers (PharmaSeq, Inc., NJ) were placed vertically. A trial began with the original nest placed in the centre of the arena and then destroyed by removing the lid. The RFID readers detected ants entering and leaving the new nests [86% tag read rate, 26] and we used handheld RFID readers to read the tags on tandem-running ants (94% tag read rate) as they crossed half-way lines (Fig. 1c). The identity of the leader and follower was thus recorded and the direction of the tandem run was noted. This procedure does not disrupt tandem runs [26]. The time at which the transport by carrying of a nest-mate or a brood item first occurred to each nest was recorded (i.e. the time at which the quorum threshold was reached). Once nest-mate transport has commenced, the RFID system becomes less reliable [26], because nest-mates are transported in such a way as to block the RFID tag. We therefore focused our analysis on searching and recruitment by tandem-running during the pre-quorum period. We observed emigrations until complete (old nest empty of brood and workers) and recorded the nest choice of the colony after 24 hours. Colonies were considered to have split if brood was present in two or more nests."	0	One day prior to an emigration trial, we attached an RFID microtransponder (50065006120 mm) with a unique ID to the thorax of every worker ant in the colony [32,33] and housed the colony in a nest formed of a hexagonal glass slide (edge length = 30 mm), a 1.5 mm cardboard perimeter (cavity area 1496 mm ) and an acetate lid with a central entrance hole (1.5 mm diameter) to avoid introducing directional bias.

CCT47	"We can subdivide comparison behaviour into two types that can aid decision-making: best-of-n comparisons and sequential comparisons. Best-of-n comparison mechanisms are characterised by a sampling period, and preferential return to the best option #CITATION_TAG. We conducted a multiple-nest experiment to test directly if real ants show these behaviours. Neither is observed. In contrast, the results support the threshold model: if the first nest they encountered was of a high quality, the ants started recruitment immediately without continuing to sample, and those ants which had the opportunity to compare nests did not act on this information by preferential or more direct return to better nests. Sequential comparisons occur when each time an animal encounters a new option, it compares the new option to its memory of previously encountered options and is more likely to accept the new one if it compares favourably. This is similar to the threshold model, but thresholds are influenced by experience. In one variant of this, individuals sample several options and then accept the next option they encounter which exceeds the quality of all previous options.

The same pattern would be observed for a threshold-rule with direct comparison (see Text S1), and also for a quality-dependent recruitment latency-rule, if it is assumed that ants search for alternatives during the latency period and have a high probability of finding other sites [20]. However, these alternative models are less parsimonious, requiring ants to remember the qualities and/or locations of visited sites and evaluate this in making subsequent comparisons or use the information to decide when and where to start recruiting. These results also clearly demonstrate that a phenomenon observed when only one option is available, cannot be assumed to function in the same way when choosing between multiple options (see also [7]). Another well-studied example of collective decision-making is nest-site choice by swarming honeybees (Apis mellifera). Like ant colonies, bee swarms are able to choose between different nest sites, and individual bees do not need to have visited multiple sites for the swarm to be able to choose between them [40]. However, the way the scouts act on this information differs between the two groups. The ants seem to use a binary decision process to either accept that nest or continue searching. Ants accepting a nest recruit others, causing a positive feedback process, but ant scouts do not modulate their recruitment according to nest quality, e.g. by recruiting at a faster rate or for longer to a higher quality nest [20,26]. In contrast, bees use a graded process, whereby scouts initially discovering a new nest-site almost always recruit [41], but the duration and rate of the recruiting waggle-dances are dependent on nest quality [42]. This means that more recruits are brought to better nest-sites, leading to a positive feedback process usually resulting in a unanimous choice of the better site [42]. One possible reason for this difference in strategy could be differences in nest availability: if suitable honeybee nest sites are relatively rare, then it might be better for scouts to avoid ever rejecting a potential nest outright.	1	In our threshold rule, the ant either commits or continues searching. In the recruitment latency hypothesis, ants which do not immediately start recruiting may subsequently recruit, with a quality-dependent latency. In the original formulation of this idea [20] it is mentioned that ants might discover other nests during this latent period, but it is not suggested that the latency is actually a result of the search for other nests. Searching for alternatives has a more prominent role in later versions of the recruitment latency model [24] making it more similar to our threshold model, however, the idea of simple quality-dependent recruitment latencies functioning as a choice mechanism still appears often in discussions of collective decisionmaking [11,38,#CITATION_TAG]. There are two empirical problems with such a mechanism. Firstly, colonies are able to choose a good nest, even when it is so much further away than a poor nest that travel time should cancel out differences in recruitment latency [27]. Secondly, all empirical evidence for quality-dependent recruitment latencies comes from studies offering a colony just one new nest [20,22,24,28].	n
CCT50	The second previously-proposed mechanism, quality dependent recruitment latencies, is an attractive idea -it does not rely on comparisons, and self-organised decisions can emerge because ants finding a poor nest delay before recruiting, effectively giving others that have found a good nest a head-start in the recruitment process. The initial advantage is amplified by recruitment, and this can be shown to be sufficient to account for collective choice [24]. In both the threshold rule and the recruitment latency hypothesis, a scout makes a probabilistic, quality-dependent decision about whether to recruit each time she visits a nest. The difference between these mechanisms come from the assumptions made about what the scout does after leaving the nest, and how this results in a colony decision-mechanism.

When recruitment latencies are measured in multiple nest experiments, no quality-dependent recruitment latencies differences are observed [this study and 26]. We used modelling to investigate these empirical results. Our simulation and analytical results reproduce quality-dependent recruitment latency in a single-nest experiment, but show that the presence of an extra nest disrupts the quality-dependence of the latency to commitment and recruitment (Figs. 5-6).

CCT52	"Collective decisions are also made in other contexts, such as choice of foraging site. Here again, comparisons of sites by individuals seems to play little role. Foraging honeybees do not compare food sources [43], nor do they compare the waggle-dances of recruiters at the hive #CITATION_TAG. Rather, multiple sites ""compete"" for foragers, with bees foraging more persistently at high quality sites and recruiting to them more energetically [43,45]. Foragers can also directly inhibit recruitment if they perceive danger at a particular food source by the use of ""stop-signals"" directed at bees recruiting to that source [46]. In trail-laying ants and bees, pheromone trails to better foraging sites are more strongly reinforced and this again leads to a collective choice without any necessity for individuals to visit multiple sites [47,48]. Just as for nest-site choice, foraging recruitment can either be graded (laying more pheromone to a better food source, e.g. [47,49]) or a binary decision (all-or-nothing recruitment, e.g. [50,51])."	1	"Collective decisions are also made in other contexts, such as choice of foraging site.

CCT53	"Animals need to make choices between multiple available options at many stages in their life histories, such as during mate selection, foraging, or when deciding where to shelter or to build a nest.

CCT54	"To illustrate these misunderstandings, we will focus on the socalled Screening and Intervention Program for Sensible drinking (SIPS) project in England. Other research on ABI could have been chosen for this purpose but SIPS is a recent and prominent evaluation, with potentially important implications for policy and practice and from which all the necessary points may be made. The project was funded by the UK Department of Health in 2006 following the publication of the Government""s Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England (AHRSE) (19). In a section on Screening and Brief Interventions, the strategy said: "". . . the research evidence on brief interventions draws heavily on small-scale studies carried out outside the UK. More information is needed on the most effective methods of targeted screening and brief interventions, and whether the successes shown in research studies can be replicated within the health system in England. . .. The Department of Health will set up a number of pilot schemes by Q1/2005 to test how best to use a variety of models of targeted screening and brief intervention in primary and secondary healthcare settings, focusing particularly on value for money and mainstreaming"" [ (19), p. 43]. This led eventually to the funding of SIPS which consisted of a pragmatic, cluster-randomized controlled trial in each of three settings: PHC, accident and emergency services, and the criminal justice system. At the time of writing, only the results for the PHC trial have been published #CITATION_TAG and the other two trials will not be covered here. As was clear in the Government""s remit for this research stated above, the trials looked at issues to do with optimal forms of screening as well as effects of different modes of ABI but only the latter is of interest here."	4	". ..

CCT55	Control groups in trials of ABI frequently show reductions in mean alcohol consumption from baseline to follow-up and this was certainly the case in the SIPS PHC trial (see Figure 2). In a review of such trials, it was calculated that control group participants reduce their drinking by approximately 20% (#CITATION_TAG,36). A reduction in drinking of this size is larger than overall differences between experimental and control groups at follow-up (2) and it is a reasonable assumption that reductions in control groups of this order may prevent the true effects of ABI from being observed (37). We also saw that the reductions in consumption shown by control group participants in the SIPS trial (or, rather, the increase in the proportion of participants not showing hazardous/harmful drinking -see Figure 2) has been wrongly assumed to have been caused by the control group procedures, i.e., the provision of a PIL and/or the feedback of assessment results. To clarify further why it is a mistake to make this inference, we will now consider other possible reasons for reductions in control group consumption. In recent times, our understanding of these reasons had been greatly assisted by the work of Dr. Jim McCambridge of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and his various colleagues.	2	Control groups in trials of ABI frequently show reductions in mean alcohol consumption from baseline to follow-up and this was certainly the case in the SIPS PHC trial (see Figure 2).

It could be, for example, that the interventions, although shown to be efficacious in randomized controlled trials conducted in ideal research conditions, are not effective in more real-world conditions of routine practice #CITATION_TAG because they have not been faithfully implemented by the practitioners taking part in the trial (27) or because of some other difference between real-world conditions and the ideal research conditions in which efficacy was demonstrated.	2	In more practical terms, in addition to sampling variability and lack of statistical power, there may be many reasons for the failure to observe a statistically significant difference between experimental and control group means.

CCT63	This must be one of the most misunderstood concepts in health care science #CITATION_TAG. It is often thought that because, for example, participants in a trial of an alcohol intervention are recruited at a particularly high point in their alcohol consumption, they make a decision to try to cut down drinking, which is reflected in their lower consumption at follow-up. This is incorrect; regression to the mean is a purely statistical phenomenon with no reference whatever to decisions by trial participants or any other causal factor impinging on the outcome variable of interest.	2	This must be one of the most misunderstood concepts in health care science #CITATION_TAG.

CCT64	If this solution were adopted, when we observed a nonsignificant result from an RCT, it would be possible to conclude that the specific form of ABI being evaluated was ineffective and not worth pursuing further, so that precious resources would not be wasted. On the other hand, we could conclude that it was unclear whether the ABI in question was effective or not and that further research was needed. The difference from the conclusion based on the conventional perspective, however, is that we would already have ruled out the possibility that the intervention was ineffective. [It is also possible that the Bayes Factor could provide evidence for the alternative hypothesis and allow the conclusion that the intervention was effective when the conventional NHST approach had not been able to reject the null hypothesis #CITATION_TAG.] This method could be applied to the non-significant results of trials such as SIPS to reduce uncertainly about and possible misunderstanding of their results. The results of an analysis of SIPS data using the Bayesian approach to null findings will form the basis of a further communication.	1	If this solution were adopted, when we observed a nonsignificant result from an RCT, it would be possible to conclude that the specific form of ABI being evaluated was ineffective and not worth pursuing further, so that precious resources would not be wasted.

CCT67	The possible effects of regression to the mean on control group participants in brief intervention trials were studied empirically by McCambridge and colleagues #CITATION_TAG. These authors gave the AUDIT to a large cohort of university students in New Zealand at baseline and 6 months later, without any attempt to intervene in their drinking. Selecting from this cohort for analysis those individuals with a baseline AUDIT score of 8+, the usual cutpoint for entry to trials of ABI, the observed mean reduction over time was approximately half that obtained in the full sample without selection. When selection was made using a series of higher AUDIT thresholds, the observed reductions in mean alcohol consumption were successively larger. This evidence suggests that a substantial part of the reduction in consumption shown by control groups can be explained by the statistical artifact of regression to the mean.	1	The possible effects of regression to the mean on control group participants in brief intervention trials were studied empirically by McCambridge and colleagues #CITATION_TAG.

CCT68	Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular ischemic events after acute coronary syndromes or percutaneous coronary interventions and is recommended in guidelines from the USA [1] and Europe [2]. Clopidogrel is an inactive prodrug that undergoes two oxidative steps involving multiple cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes in its bioactivation to its pharmacologically active metabolite. Among them, CYP2C19, a CYP enzyme whose activity is determined genetically, contributes predominantly to this bioactivation [3,4] and modulates the antiplatelet and therapeutic response to clopidogrel. Patients with loss of function polymorphism in the CYP2C19 gene are less responsive to clopidogrel [5,6], although the importance of this phenomenon remains controversial #CITATION_TAG[8][9][10] and may be limited to the risk of stent thrombosis [11].	0	Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular ischemic events after acute coronary syndromes or percutaneous coronary interventions and is recommended in guidelines from the USA [1] and Europe [2].

Patients with loss of function polymorphism in the CYP2C19 gene are less responsive to clopidogrel [5,6], although the importance of this phenomenon remains controversial [7][8][9][10] and may be limited to the risk of stent thrombosis [11].	0	Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular ischemic events after acute coronary syndromes or percutaneous coronary interventions and is recommended in guidelines from the USA [1] and Europe #CITATION_TAG.

CCT84	As an inhibitory interaction is not expected to occur in subjects who do not have an adequate response in the absence of inhibitor, the predefined group of VASP good antiplatelet responders was chosen to examine the pharmacodynamic interactions between rabeprazole and clopidogrel. The VASP index is considered as a specific test for evaluating P2Y12 inhibition, while light-transmission aggregometry is used to predict outcome during dual  antiplatelet therapy, although both tests have a predictive value [31,33,39,#CITATION_TAG]. In the group of good VASP antiplatelet responders, the clopidogrel antiplatelet effect remained non-inferior to placebo at D7H0 and D7H4 during rabeprazole co-administration, whereas it crossed the limit of noninferiority during omeprazole co-administration. Therefore, from a pharmacodynamic point of view, in subjects in whom clopidogrel elicits a marked antiplatelet effect, inhibition of clopidogrel antiplatelet action is minimal with rabeprazole, whereas a statistically significant reversal of clopidogrel effects is observed with omeprazole.	5	As an inhibitory interaction is not expected to occur in subjects who do not have an adequate response in the absence of inhibitor, the predefined group of VASP good antiplatelet responders was chosen to examine the pharmacodynamic interactions between rabeprazole and clopidogrel.

CCT85	Concerns about PPI and clopidogrel interaction were raised when omeprazole was found to inhibit the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel in an in vivo study of 124 patients undergoing elective coronary stent implantation [21]. Several studies have suggested that omeprazole interacts with clopidogrel efficacy by inhibiting the formation of its active metabolite via CYP2C19 inhibition [22,23]. Whether this occurs with all PPIs or is even of significant amplitude with omeprazole remains a matter of debate [9,[24][25][26][27][28][29]. However, it was recently demonstrated that generation of clopidogrel active metabolite and inhibition of platelet function are reduced less by the co-administration of dexlansoprazole or lansoprazole with clopidogrel than by the co-administration of esomeprazole or omeprazole #CITATION_TAG.	2	Concerns about PPI and clopidogrel interaction were raised when omeprazole was found to inhibit the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel in an in vivo study of 124 patients undergoing elective coronary stent implantation [21].

CCT86	As expected [22,23], CYP2C19 genotype and activity influenced clopidogrel antiplatelet activity in the absence of PPI, with greater inhibition of platelet aggregation in homozygous EM subjects compared with subjects with at least one non-functional CYP2C19 allele. Also, during the placebo study period, clopidogrel-induced change in VASP index and platelet aggregation induced by 10 M (but not 20 M) ADP correlated with CYP2C19 activity, as assessed by the use of the omeprazole metabolic ratio. However, the association was weak, with only about 18% of antiplatelet effect explained by the omeprazole metabolic ratio. During PPI administrations, no significant correlation was found between the change in VASP index or the change in the AUC of clopidogrel active metabolite and CYP2C19 activity as assessed by the omeprazole metabolic ratio. Such an absence of association by regression analysis raises the question of the role of CYP2C19 inhibition in explaining our findings. Rabeprazole is mainly metabolized by nonenzymatic reduction to rabeprazole thioether [41] and is a less potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 than omeprazole [14,#CITATION_TAG,43]. This may explain why rabeprazole had less effect than omeprazole on the clopidogrel-induced change in VASP index, although the study was not powered to test the statistical significance of this difference. However, this does not explain the similarity of the pharmacokinetic interaction of clopidogrel active metabolite with both PPIs. In this respect, pantoprazole [19] and rabeprazole appear to have similar profiles. Also, rabeprazole thioether, the main circulating metabolite of rabeprazole, is a CYP2C19 inhibitor [14] and could have contributed to the observed effects. Finally, CYP2C19 is not the only CYP that contributes to the bioactivation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite [4]. CYP2C19 contributes to the first step of clopidogrel metabolism to its 2-oxo unstable metabolite by 45% while CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 contribute by 36% and 19%, respectively. CYP2C19 contributes to the final step of clopidogrel active metabolite formation from 2-oxoclopidogrel by only 20% while CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 contribute by 40%, 33% and 7%, respectively [4]. It is therefore conceivable that non-CYP2C19-mediated mechanisms may contribute to the interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel.	4	However, the association was weak, with only about 18% of antiplatelet effect explained by the omeprazole metabolic ratio.

Whether this occurs with all PPIs or is even of significant amplitude with omeprazole remains a matter of debate [9,[24][25][26][27]#CITATION_TAG[29]. However, it was recently demonstrated that generation of clopidogrel active metabolite and inhibition of platelet function are reduced less by the co-administration of dexlansoprazole or lansoprazole with clopidogrel than by the co-administration of esomeprazole or omeprazole [30].	4	Concerns about PPI and clopidogrel interaction were raised when omeprazole was found to inhibit the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel in an in vivo study of 124 patients undergoing elective coronary stent implantation [21].

CCT113	We regressed mean dominance durations against resting state connectivity from our two seed regions to determine which areas of cortex were involved in determining the dynamics of bistable alternations. We found that the coupling between the aSPL seed and regions of the striatum (green regions in Figure 3a) showed a greater association with faster alternations for the binocular rivalry stimulus (i.e. shorter durations). The striatum is known to be important in relaying prediction error signals to primary regions of cortex (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2011) and might play this role in perceptual decision making (Forstmann et al., 2010; though see also Boekel et al., 2015).	0	We regressed mean dominance durations against resting state connectivity from our two seed regions to determine which areas of cortex were involved in determining the dynamics of bistable alternations.

CCT114	The current study explores the functional connectivity of two regions of the superior parietal lobule (SPL) that have been shown to play a key role in bistable perception in studies using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Application of TMS to the anterior region of the superior parietal lobule (aSPL) in the right hemisphere causes binocular rivalry and bistable motion alternations to speed up (Carmel et al., 2010;Kanai et al., 2011). By contrast, a more posterior region of the same structure (pSPL) slows down the alternations of a bistable structure from motion stimulus when targeted with TMS (Kanai et al., 2010). The apparently opposing functions of these two regions of the SPL is surprising given their physical proximity (see Figure 2). Recent fMRI work has demonstrated that the regions interact with visual areas involved in processing motion to resolve bistable motion percepts, and the strengths of connections are able to predict individual alternation rates accurately (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2015).	4	Application of TMS to the anterior region of the superior parietal lobule (aSPL) in the right hemisphere causes binocular rivalry and bistable motion alternations to speed up (Carmel et al., 2010;Kanai et al., 2011).

CCT115	Identifying the neural correlates of bistable perception by recording online activity, however, may confound activity that is causally linked to bistable alternations with activity that is merely correlated with it. The finding that activity in a given brain region (e.g. frontoparietal cortex Kleinschmidt et al., 1998;Lumer and Rees, 1999;Sterzer and Kleinschmidt, 2007;Weilnhammer et al., 2013) correlates with perception does not reveal whether that region drives the alternations, or reflects a consequence of processes occurring elsewhere. Carefully controlling for the character of perceptual transitions has been shown to dramatically reduce the number of brain regions that are viable candidates for determining alternations (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2011). Consequently, it is still a matter of debate whether different forms of bistable stimuli depend on bottom-up or top down influences, and which specific neural systems support these aspects of conscious experience. The current work capitalizes on the fact that stimulus-independent changes in neural processing occur naturally during wakeful rest. Neuroimaging has revealed that almost all functional networks that support aspects of task related processing have a comparable resting state network (Smith et al., 2009), and the integrity of these networks varies across individuals in a manner that is predictive of complex forms of cognition such as meta cognitive accuracy (Baird et al., 2013), spontaneous thought (Gorgolewski et al., 2014), reading comprehension (Smallwood et al., 2013) and executive control (Reineberg et al., 2015). As the neural activity at rest is uncontaminated by external input, it provides a relatively pure method to explore stimulusindependent neural processes and so a useful tool to understand the functional architecture of bistable perception.	4	Identifying the neural correlates of bistable perception by recording online activity, however, may confound activity that is causally linked to bistable alternations with activity that is merely correlated with it.

Neuroimaging has revealed that almost all functional networks that support aspects of task related processing have a comparable resting state network (Smith et al., 2009), and the integrity of these networks varies across individuals in a manner that is predictive of complex forms of cognition such as meta cognitive accuracy (Baird et al., 2013), spontaneous thought (Gorgolewski et al., 2014), reading comprehension (Smallwood et al., 2013) and executive control (Reineberg et al., 2015).	r
CCT116	A remarkable feature of the human mind is its capacity to process information that is independent of environmental input. We often lose ourselves in our thoughts, decoupling experience from the here and now (Baird et al., 2014). At other times we suddenly realize that we having been looking at the world from the wrong perspective: many famous visual illusions depend upon the resolution of uncertain perceptual input (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2009). These examples demonstrate that our conscious experience of our surroundings does not depend solely on the sensory information we receive at any moment in time, an observation that allows insight into the stimulus-independent basis of conscious perception. A popular way to study this dissociation between sensory inputs and conscious experience is to use stimuli that are ambiguous in their interpretation, and for which perception alternates over time. Classic examples include binocular rivalry (Figure 1a), in which incompatible images shown to the two eyes compete for awareness, and the Necker cube (see Figure 1b), in which a wire-frame cube can be perceived from multiple perspectives. Understanding the neural architecture that mediates these alternations is considered a critical step in uncovering neural correlates of consciousness (Crick and Koch, 1998).	0	A remarkable feature of the human mind is its capacity to process information that is independent of environmental input.

CCT117	The current study explores the functional connectivity of two regions of the superior parietal lobule (SPL) that have been shown to play a key role in bistable perception in studies using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Application of TMS to the anterior region of the superior parietal lobule (aSPL) in the right hemisphere causes binocular rivalry and bistable motion alternations to speed up (Carmel et al., 2010;#CITATION_TAG et al., 2011). By contrast, a more posterior region of the same structure (pSPL) slows down the alternations of a bistable structure from motion stimulus when targeted with TMS (Kanai et al., 2010). The apparently opposing functions of these two regions of the SPL is surprising given their physical proximity (see Figure 2). Recent fMRI work has demonstrated that the regions interact with visual areas involved in processing motion to resolve bistable motion percepts, and the strengths of connections are able to predict individual alternation rates accurately (Megumi et al., 2015).	4	The current study explores the functional connectivity of two regions of the superior parietal lobule (SPL) that have been shown to play a key role in bistable perception in studies using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).

CCT123	We found evidence that anterior and posterior regions of superior parietal cortex which influence bistable perception in opposing directions do so because of differences in their functional architecture. Our seed region in the pSPL exhibited connectivity with regions of parietal and lateral prefrontal cortex whose specialism is in the extraction of higher order features of sensory input (Duncan, 2010;Goldman-Rakic, 1988). This functional network is consistent with prior fMRI studies that have found a relationship between alternations and activity in similar regions of fronto-parietal cortex (Kleinschmidt et al., 1998;Knapen et al., 2011;Lumer and Rees, 1999;Sterzer and Kleinschmidt, 2007;Watanabe et al., 2014;Weilnhammer et al., 2013).

This brain region is important in visual aspects of semantics (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2004;Visser et al., 2010) and activity there is suppressed when an image is rendered invisible by rivalry suppression (Fang and He, 2005). Together these data are consistent with the claim that the pSPL is part of a distributed functional system that helps stabilize a specific interpretation of low-level perceptual input.	0	Our seed region in the pSPL exhibited connectivity with regions of parietal and lateral prefrontal cortex whose specialism is in the extraction of higher order features of sensory input (Duncan, 2010;Goldman-Rakic, 1988).

CCT129	In contrast to the pSPL, the aSPL was connected to regions of sensori motor cortex that are thought to serve functions more closely tethered to sensory input (Buckner and Krienen, 2013). Importantly, our data show that strong aSPL connectivity with the striatum was linked to shorter rivalrous durations. Given the potential role of the striatum in prediction error (Forstmann et al., 2010), this pattern of heightened connectivity suggests that during binocular rivalry, a specific percept may remain dominant as long as the competing low-level input is suppressed. Consistent with this interpretation of our data, recent work has shown that increasing the reward associated with a particular stimulus, a manipulation that increases the magnitude of a prediction error signal, increases the dominance of that particular stimulus (#CITATION_TAG and Einhauser, 2015). Compared with resolving binocular rivalry, viewing a Necker cube involves overcoming incongruency in perceptual input at a relatively higher level. Connectivity between the aSPL and a region of dorso-medial prefrontal cortex was enhanced for participants with relatively longer dominance durations for the Necker cube. This region of pre-frontal cortex is implicated in the top-down coordination of cognition and action (Botvinick et al., 2004). Importantly, this region overlaps with the connectivity patterns of the pSPL (see Figure 4) suggesting that it is functionally connected to information arising in a bottom up manner from sensori-motor cortex and in a top down manner from information in associative cortex (see also Watanabe et al., 2014). This convergence of information would be especially important in allowing perceptual incongruity to be resolved at relatively complex levels such as that which occurs while viewing the Necker Cube.	0	In contrast to the pSPL, the aSPL was connected to regions of sensori motor cortex that are thought to serve functions more closely tethered to sensory input (Buckner and Krienen, 2013).

Our seed region in the pSPL exhibited connectivity with regions of parietal and lateral prefrontal cortex whose specialism is in the extraction of higher order features of sensory input (Duncan, 2010;Goldman-Rakic, 1988). This functional network is consistent with prior fMRI studies that have found a relationship between alternations and activity in similar regions of fronto-parietal cortex (Kleinschmidt et al., 1998;Knapen et al., 2011;Lumer and Rees, 1999;Sterzer and Kleinschmidt, 2007;Watanabe et al., 2014;Weilnhammer et al., 2013). Importantly, Experiment Two found that connectivity between pSPL and ventral aspects of the temporal lobe was enhanced for individuals who experienced slower rivalry alternations. This brain region is important in visual aspects of semantics (Squire et al., 2004;#CITATION_TAG et al., 2010) and activity there is suppressed when an image is rendered invisible by rivalry suppression (Fang and He, 2005). Together these data are consistent with the claim that the pSPL is part of a distributed functional system that helps stabilize a specific interpretation of low-level perceptual input.	2	Our seed region in the pSPL exhibited connectivity with regions of parietal and lateral prefrontal cortex whose specialism is in the extraction of higher order features of sensory input (Duncan, 2010;Goldman-Rakic, 1988).

CCT132	Identifying the neural correlates of bistable perception by recording online activity, however, may confound activity that is causally linked to bistable alternations with activity that is merely correlated with it. The finding that activity in a given brain region (e.g. frontoparietal cortex Kleinschmidt et al., 1998;Lumer and Rees, 1999;Sterzer and Kleinschmidt, 2007;Weilnhammer et al., 2013) correlates with perception does not reveal whether that region drives the alternations, or reflects a consequence of processes occurring elsewhere. Carefully controlling for the character of perceptual transitions has been shown to dramatically reduce the number of brain regions that are viable candidates for determining alternations (Knapen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is still a matter of debate whether different forms of bistable stimuli depend on bottom-up or top down influences, and which specific neural systems support these aspects of conscious experience. The current work capitalizes on the fact that stimulus-independent changes in neural processing occur naturally during wakeful rest. Neuroimaging has revealed that almost all functional networks that support aspects of task related processing have a comparable resting state network (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2009), and the integrity of these networks varies across individuals in a manner that is predictive of complex forms of cognition such as meta cognitive accuracy (Baird et al., 2013), spontaneous thought (Gorgolewski et al., 2014), reading comprehension (Smallwood et al., 2013) and executive control (Reineberg et al., 2015). As the neural activity at rest is uncontaminated by external input, it provides a relatively pure method to explore stimulusindependent neural processes and so a useful tool to understand the functional architecture of bistable perception.	5	Carefully controlling for the character of perceptual transitions has been shown to dramatically reduce the number of brain regions that are viable candidates for determining alternations (Knapen et al., 2011).

CCT133	We seeded two adjacent parietal regions in the right hemisphere for a set of resting state fMRI scans collected from 141 participants (Nooner et al., 2012). The network associated with the anterior seed (red button in the upper right panel of Figure 2) involved the occipital lobe, regions of the parietal lobe, and the dorsal surface of the temporal lobe. The network associated with the posterior seed (blue button in the upper right panel of Figure 2) involved lateral regions of temporo-parietal cortex, elements of the temporal lobe, and dorsolateral regions of the prefrontal cortex. We verified the distinctness of these two networks using a large meta-analytic resting state database (www.neurosynth.org; #CITATION_TAG et al., 2011), that produced similar (though less extensive) networks, shown in Supplementary Figure S1. It is noteworthy that the connectivity of the aSPL seed was targeted at primary sensori-motor regions, whereas the connectivity of the pSPL seed region connected with regions of associative cortex (e.g. the temporal lobe and lateral/medial regions of the dorsal prefrontal cortex).	5	The network associated with the anterior seed (red button in the upper right panel of Figure 2) involved the occipital lobe, regions of the parietal lobe, and the dorsal surface of the temporal lobe.

A popular way to study this dissociation between sensory inputs and conscious experience is to use stimuli that are ambiguous in their interpretation, and for which perception alternates over time. Classic examples include binocular rivalry (Figure 1a), in which incompatible images shown to the two eyes compete for awareness, and the Necker cube (see Figure 1b), in which a wire-frame cube can be perceived from multiple perspectives. Understanding the neural architecture that mediates these alternations is considered a critical step in uncovering neural correlates of consciousness (Crick and Koch, 1998).	0	A remarkable feature of the human mind is its capacity to process information that is independent of environmental input.

CCT135	In contrast to the pSPL, the aSPL was connected to regions of sensori motor cortex that are thought to serve functions more closely tethered to sensory input (Buckner and Krienen, 2013). Importantly, our data show that strong aSPL connectivity with the striatum was linked to shorter rivalrous durations. Given the potential role of the striatum in prediction error (Forstmann et al., 2010), this pattern of heightened connectivity suggests that during binocular rivalry, a specific percept may remain dominant as long as the competing low-level input is suppressed. Consistent with this interpretation of our data, recent work has shown that increasing the reward associated with a particular stimulus, a manipulation that increases the magnitude of a prediction error signal, increases the dominance of that particular stimulus (Marx and Einhauser, 2015). Compared with resolving binocular rivalry, viewing a Necker cube involves overcoming incongruency in perceptual input at a relatively higher level. Connectivity between the aSPL and a region of dorso-medial prefrontal cortex was enhanced for participants with relatively longer dominance durations for the Necker cube. This region of pre-frontal cortex is implicated in the top-down coordination of cognition and action (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2004). Importantly, this region overlaps with the connectivity patterns of the pSPL (see Figure 4) suggesting that it is functionally connected to information arising in a bottom up manner from sensori-motor cortex and in a top down manner from information in associative cortex (see also Watanabe et al., 2014). This convergence of information would be especially important in allowing perceptual incongruity to be resolved at relatively complex levels such as that which occurs while viewing the Necker Cube.	0	Consistent with this interpretation of our data, recent work has shown that increasing the reward associated with a particular stimulus, a manipulation that increases the magnitude of a prediction error signal, increases the dominance of that particular stimulus (Marx and Einhauser, 2015).

CCT146	The current study explores the functional connectivity of two regions of the superior parietal lobule (SPL) that have been shown to play a key role in bistable perception in studies using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Application of TMS to the anterior region of the superior parietal lobule (aSPL) in the right hemisphere causes binocular rivalry and bistable motion alternations to speed up (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2010;Kanai et al., 2011). By contrast, a more posterior region of the same structure (pSPL) slows down the alternations of a bistable structure from motion stimulus when targeted with TMS (Kanai et al., 2010). The apparently opposing functions of these two regions of the SPL is surprising given their physical proximity (see Figure 2). Recent fMRI work has demonstrated that the regions interact with visual areas involved in processing motion to resolve bistable motion percepts, and the strengths of connections are able to predict individual alternation rates accurately (Megumi et al., 2015).	4	The current study explores the functional connectivity of two regions of the superior parietal lobule (SPL) that have been shown to play a key role in bistable perception in studies using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).

Compared with resolving binocular rivalry, viewing a Necker cube involves overcoming incongruency in perceptual input at a relatively higher level. Connectivity between the aSPL and a region of dorso-medial prefrontal cortex was enhanced for participants with relatively longer dominance durations for the Necker cube. This region of pre-frontal cortex is implicated in the top-down coordination of cognition and action (Botvinick et al., 2004). Importantly, this region overlaps with the connectivity patterns of the pSPL (see Figure 4) suggesting that it is functionally connected to information arising in a bottom up manner from sensori-motor cortex and in a top down manner from information in associative cortex (see also Watanabe et al., 2014). This convergence of information would be especially important in allowing perceptual incongruity to be resolved at relatively complex levels such as that which occurs while viewing the Necker Cube.	0	In contrast to the pSPL, the aSPL was connected to regions of sensori motor cortex that are thought to serve functions more closely tethered to sensory input (#CITATION_TAG and Krienen, 2013). Importantly, our data show that strong aSPL connectivity with the striatum was linked to shorter rivalrous durations. Given the potential role of the striatum in prediction error (Forstmann et al., 2010), this pattern of heightened connectivity suggests that during binocular rivalry, a specific percept may remain dominant as long as the competing low-level input is suppressed. Consistent with this interpretation of our data, recent work has shown that increasing the reward associated with a particular stimulus, a manipulation that increases the magnitude of a prediction error signal, increases the dominance of that particular stimulus (Marx and Einhauser, 2015).

CCT158	Kollath et al. #CITATION_TAG rationalized the slow relaxation they found for large by focusing on the particle and hole excitations of the Mott insulator. If quasiparticle interactions are ignored, then the effective Hamiltonian in the Mott regime may be written in the form = ∑ k, k † k k , with † k a creation operator for a quasiparticle in the Mott insulator. Thermalization then proceeds through the relaxation of the quasiparticle distribution given by the initial conditions. This requires processes in which quasiparticle number is not conserved, which are strongly suppressed if the gap Δ is larger than /2 where ∼ 4 is the quasiparticle bandwidth. Higher order processes could still lead to thermalization, but on much longer timescales than accessible numerically. This picture relies on having a dilute quasiparticle population, that is, an initial state close to the transition, but at least in their numerics, = 2 , appear to have been sufficiently close to the transition ( = 3.37 in 1 dimension [44] and = 16.7 in 2 dimensions [41]) for this physics to be observable.	4	Kollath et al. #CITATION_TAG rationalized the slow relaxation they found for large by focusing on the particle and hole excitations of the Mott insulator.

If ≪ , then the model describes weakly interacting bosons hopping on a lattice, ISRN Condensed Matter Physics 3 which will condense and lead to a superfluid at low temperatures. In the opposite limit of = 0, the ground state can be determined by considering the single site Hamiltonian 0 . Working in the grand canonical ensemble (results in the canonical ensemble can be obtained by a Legendre transformation), the ground state energy is minimized for 0 bosons on each site when the chemical potential satisfies 0 ≤ / ≤ + 1. This phase with an integer number of bosons per site is the incompressible Mott insulator. For finite / , there is generically a transition between the Mott insulator and superfluid phases.

CCT176	A similar role as a dissecting spatial feature can also be ascribed to the Rhône-Saône river system during the onset of the Last Glacial Maximum (Fig. 6b). The large fluviophysiographic feature separates the Solutrean from the Early Epigravettien (Floss 2000a(Floss , 2005Banks et al. 2008;Hussain and Floss 2014). Banks et al. (2008) have suggested that this spatial pattern is largely a function of crucially different ecological conditions east and west of the Rhône River, leading to completely different technocultural adaptations. Nevertheless, it is still reasonable to argue that periglacial permafrost conditions in the Rhône Valley, with successive freezing and flooding events (Banks et al. 2008), hampered communication between human groups east and west of its banks. Along with the impact of nearby mountain ranges, glaciers, and associated glacial lakes, this would have resulted in a spatial configuration limiting human movement and communication across the river system. This setting, therefore, would have created strong affordances for avoiding the area and favors sociocultural frontier notions. The succeeding Badegoulian technocultural entity conserves this eastern margin, coinciding with the course of the Rhône-Saône river regime (Floss 2000a;#CITATION_TAG et al. 2011).

CCT181	This idea largely dates back to the Continental European tradition of philosophical inquiry, broadly characterized as phenomenological, and most prominently advocated by Martin Heidegger and Maurice Merleau-Ponty (cf. Cataldi and Hamrick 2007). Both argue that humans are before anything else Bbeings-in-the-world^ (Heidegger 1927a, b;Merleau-Ponty 1945, 1964. They are thrown into predefined spatial settings, enriched by the respective cultural traditions and underpinned by the physiographic properties of the surrounding landscapes. Perception, experience, and behavior thus emerge from the complex interplay of natural environments and cultural systems. Consequently, it is the phenomenology of a particular setting that becomes central to human spatial dwelling and the resulting archaeological patterning. Accordingly, Bspatial turn^advocates (cf. Dünne and Günzel 2006;Döring and Thielmann 2008;Günzel 2009;Warf and Arias 2009;Bachman-Medick 2010) have convincingly argued for the Bsocially constructed^and Bculturally built^dimension of space emphasizing the human factor therein (e.g., Ashmore and Knapp 1999;Muir 2000;Lang 2009). Each spatial feature has therefore to be understood as an entanglement of natural properties and sociocultural dimensions (e.g., Gamble 1993;Tilley 1994;Rockman 2003;Meskell and Preucel 2004;Edgeworth 2011;#CITATION_TAG 2012). As a result, the specific and potentially changing place of individual spatial entities within larger Becocultural systems^(sensu Rapport and Maffi 2010, p. 104; see also Pretty and Pilgrim 2010 and references therein) can be extremely informative.	4	Perception, experience, and behavior thus emerge from the complex interplay of natural environments and cultural systems.

CCT182	"Evidence for the movement of lithic raw materials along the great Danube River during the Magdalenian is most notably constituted by BPlattenhornstein,^a special tabular chert variety that originates in the Franconian Jura (Floss 1994). Pieces of this particular raw material group appear in several Magdalenian sites of the Swabian Jura, bridging distances up to 160 km up-river and connecting both regions (Floss 1994(Floss , 2000aBurkert and Floss 2005;Maier 2012a; compare Table 1). It is important to note that these raw materials are by no means the only physical indication for an east-west interconnectivity of the Central European Magdalenian parallel to the Danube. The Upper Danube area shares some striking sociocultural peculiarities, from which regularly red-dotted stones, often plaquettes, are particularly worth mentioning (Conard and Floss 1999;Conard and Uerpmann 2000;Conard 2001, 2009;Conard and Malina 2010). They have been found in Magdalenian layers of Hohle Fels and Kleine Scheuer in the Swabian Jura and, among others, in Obere Klause in the Altmühl Valley (#CITATION_TAG and Floss 2014;Conard et al. 2015, p. 109), thus clearly revealing an area of Bcommon cultural heritage^and an enclosed communication space at the least (Floss 2014;Hussain and Floss 2014). These findings are consistent with Erikson""s (2002) suggestion that the emphasis on lithic raw material transfer (interpreted as expression of direct or embedded procurement) on this spatial axis would favor scenarios of actual group movement along the Danube. From this perspective, the material evidence clearly points to a mediating role of the Danube River system in the Magdalenian, channeling and regulating both the flow of people and materials."	2	"Pieces of this particular raw material group appear in several Magdalenian sites of the Swabian Jura, bridging distances up to 160 km up-river and connecting both regions (Floss 1994(Floss , 2000aBurkert and Floss 2005;Maier 2012a; compare Table 1).

Recent radiocarbon dates from the key Swabian Jura sites of Hohle Fels and Geißenklösterle in the Ach valley, a small tributary of the Upper Danube, support this view and place the earliest occupation in the region even before Heinrich event IV (Conard 2009a;Higham et al. 2012Higham et al. , 2014. Dates between 40 and 42 ka cal.

We would argue that the emergence of a regionally distinct tradition of figurine and ornament making already signals the end of a true Bpioneer phaseî n the initial incursion into the European mainland. From this perspective, the very early and therefore pioneer Aurignacian assemblages reflecting an initial advance into largely unknown landscapes are expected to be even more rudimentary and ephemeral in this respect (cf. Davies 2001Davies , 2007. Recent evidence from Willendorf II in Lower Austria is in strong agreement with this model and demonstrates the presence of Aurignacian technologies without personal ornaments and figurines along the Danube already before ka cal.

CCT185	"To conclude, it appears that Aurignacian site occurrence at the European scale is strongly correlated with the presence of large river systems in the landscape (Otte 1979;Davies 2001;. Individual prominent, accessible, and strongly accommodating river systems considerably shape the sociocultural geography of the Aurignacian record. These rivers clearly serve as key features ensuring connectivity between various occupational areas. We would argue that the role of these river systems as communication corridors and mobility conduits is largely a result of both their ecophysiographic characteristics and the unique social context of dispersal and migration. To begin with, if we accept the two-phase dispersal model of Aurignacian technologies, with a pioneer and a consolidated phase reflected in different sociocultural signatures (Davies 2001(Davies , 2007, the conditions of landscape knowledge and learning deserve special attention (e.g., Golledge 2003;Kelly 2003). It is reasonable to assume that AMH groups entering Europe experienced largely unknown and unfamiliar landscapes and had very limited ecological knowledge on which spatial behavior, food acquisition, and sociocultural topology could be based. Large rivers are then very likely to play a key role because they are reliable spatial heuristics for orientation and the exploitation of the wider landscape. The visual prominence and physical accessibility of mostly braided river systems in the Early Aurignacian cold climatic phase further enhances their affordance structure. In the wider ecocultural system of Aurignacian times, these rivers can therefore be characterized as anchor points that organize spatial cognition and performance. #CITATION_TAG (1978) already pointed out that such anchoring features are designated to hierarchically structure the local environment around them and serve as a Bcheap^and effective means of landscape use and way-finding in particular (see also Couclelis et al. 1987). This emerging property would thus underscore the integral role of large rivers in the context of Bfast and frugal^decision-making during human expansion and colonization. Gärling et al. (1984) have shown that the Benvironmental legibility^that contributes to a spatial feature""s experienced quality varies according to the conditions of landscape knowledge and can thus be discussed in relation to three main stages: exploratory, adaptive, and abstract. The exploratory stage, broadly equitable to dispersal and migration scenarios, is generally characterized by the dominance of visual experience in orientation. Human groups therefore use concrete spatial representations mainly related to focal physiographic features (Golledge 2003, p. 36). Moreover, there seems to be a positive relationship between Blandscape unfamiliarity^and the focality of spatial features that impact the mobility of social groups (Kelly 2003, p. 48). In the adaptive and abstract stages, on the other hand, sociocultural meaning becomes increasingly separated from physiographic properties. This general matrix of spatial performance might explain why large river systems play such an important role in the successive settlement of the European continent, both as directing and channeling spatial features, and offers a parsimonious blueprint for interpreting the spatiality of the Aurignacian record (compare Fig. 5)."	5	"Large rivers are then very likely to play a key role because they are reliable spatial heuristics for orientation and the exploitation of the wider landscape.

CCT186	"The idea, that large river systems coincide with social boundaries and thus structure the Paleolithic world on larger scales, has been extremely influential in the field""s history. Some of these ideas even had a deep impact on how scholars recognized the entire period. Most famously, Hallam L. Movius claimed in the middle of the last century the existence of a demarcation line dividing the Lower Paleolithic into two hemispheres, one with bifaces and the other lacking them (Movius 1949). He identified the BMovius line^as a robust spatiotemporal feature in Central Europe thought to be largely identical with the course of the River Rhine. For a long time, scholars therefore considered the famous biface of Hochdahl as the only handaxe occurrence east of the river and beyond the Movius line (Andree 1939, 569ff.;Bosinski 2008, p. 113). Another famous historical example is the case of the Nile Valley seemingly forming the eastern margin of the Aterian world within the greater North African Middle Stone Age complex (#CITATION_TAG 1946;Marks 1975, p. 440;Debénath 1986, p. 25;Kleindienst 2000Kleindienst , 2001Hublin and McPherron 2012;Scerri 2013)."	0	He identified the BMovius line^as a robust spatiotemporal feature in Central Europe thought to be largely identical with the course of the River Rhine.

However, as Prentice and Miller (2007) note, studies of essentialism and sexual prejudice in the domain of sexual orientation typically examine the belief in the idea that sexual orientation is itself an ""essential"" reality, whereas discussions of essentialism and ethnic prejudice typically refer to belief in the reality of stereotypes linking category membership with other traits. Heterosexual people who consider sexual orientation to be genetic are often less prejudiced. However, heterosexual people who consider that there is a gene that ties homosexuality to disease might not be. Ironically, genetic research on sexual orientation that has been widely announced as pro-gay research also aimed to determine a genetic link between homosexuality and alcoholism (c.f., Hamer & Copeland, 1994).

CCT210	Arthroscopic meniscus surgery is a high-volume surgery. 1 Little is known about the natural time course of PROs after meniscus surgery and which factors affect these outcomes. This prospective cohort will collect data from a large number of patients on the natural time course of PROs prior and following arthroscopic meniscus surgery. Our results will enable analysis of the dependence of postsurgery outcome on the type of meniscus tear (ie, TT vs NTT in middle-aged patients). Further, it will be possible to investigate the dependence of postsurgery outcome on the type of surgery in the subgroup of patients with TT (ie, TT RES vs TT REP ). In contrast, other on-going randomised placebo controlled trials are investigating the effect of meniscus surgery for patients with degenerative tears. 45 46 this study a pragmatic clinical approach was chosen to categorise meniscus tears as either TT or NTT (ie, degenerative). The advantages of this approach are that it is simple, cheap, can be determined prior to surgery (in contrast to histology or arthroscopic observation) and feasible in a routine clinical setting. Thus, this information can be used to form an algorithm based on information available prior to surgery to select those patients who benefit most from surgery, which can be implemented in clinical practice. The definition of TT and NTT are similar but not identical to what has previously been used in other studies. Camanho et al 12 divided the patients into three groups; traumatic, degenerative and fatigue. In the present study the NTT group will include degenerative as well as fatigue as defined by Camanho et al as the focus of this study is on the traumatic versus non-traumatic initiation of the meniscal tear. Others have based their definition on sports participation. #CITATION_TAG limitation to this study is that patients are included based on the main reason for surgery (ie, suspicion of a meniscus tear). However, meniscus surgery may also be performed in relation to surgery for other knee pathologies. Those patients will not be included in the KACS. This should be taken into account when interpreting the cohort data. On the other hand, this makes it more likely that patient symptoms in the KACS cohort are primarily caused by the meniscus injury. Furthermore, we expect the age to be different in the TT compared with the NTT groups (ie, NTT group being older), thus all statistical analysis will be adjusted for age. Nevertheless, this should still be taken into consideration when interpreting the results.	1	Camanho et al 12 divided the patients into three groups; traumatic, degenerative and fatigue.

CCT214	Approximately 100 fish species are in the West-central Mexico, 70% of which are endemic and one of the most representative endemic fish groups of this region is the subfamily Goodeinae [5]. The group presents high species richness in a small area (c. 41 species) and unique characteristics associated with breeding strategies and embryo development, such as internal fertilization, matrotrophy, and sexual selection #CITATION_TAG[10][11][12][13]. The family presents a high diversification apparently influenced by viviparity, with vicariance and adaptive radiation being the most important factors.

CCT216	The genus Allotoca is the most diverse within the Goodeinae, and is the subject of taxonomic controversy, with the need for taxonomic revision to validate species [9,10,#CITATION_TAG[16][17]. The A. diazi complex comprises three recognized species [5]: Allotoca diazi [18], endemic to Pátzcuaro basin, A. meeki [16], endemic in the Zirahuén basin, and Allotoca catarinae [15], restricted to the Cupatitzio River, an upper tributary of the Balsas River basin (Fig 1). Allotoca diazi was extirpated from Pátzcuaro Lake and is currently restricted to the Chapultepec Spring, a tributary of Pátzcuaro Lake, while A. meeki was extirpated from Zirahuén Lake and currently restricted to Opopeo Spring, a tributary of the Zirahuén Lake [5]. The lakes are located in the Michoacán-Guanajuato Corridor, an area of over 1000 volcanic cones active from the Pliocene to the present. To explain the evolution of these three sister species and other co-distributed taxa, two biogeographic hypotheses have been proposed. The first argues the existence of a tributary connecting the Lerma River with Cuitzeo, Pátzcuaro, and Zirahuén lakes [19] around 700 000 years ago [20].

We obtained these molecular markers to explore the genetic differentiation at intraspecific and interspecific level applying phylogeographic and phylogenetic approaches. The results of the genetic study were analyzed based on geological, paleoclimatic and anthropogenic records from central Mexico to access how natural and artificial historical processes are involved in the evolutionary history of A. diazi complex.

Tecto-volcanic events giving rise to the separation of Pátzcuaro and Zirahuén lakes began 8000 years ago with the formation and activity of the La Tasa volcano southwest of Lake Pátzcuaro and climate fluctuations causing decline in water level and drying of streams [21,[90][91][92][93]. Fluctuations in the level of Lake Pátzcuaro during the Holocene associated with climate change, human activity [90,91,[#CITATION_TAG][95][96][97][98][99], and occurrence of tsunamis [100] could be involved to the isolation and demographics changes of A. diazi and A. meeki. These demographic changes were reflected in genetic diversity including the positive D T value, which was found to be low in A. diazi, and associated with recent bottlenecks that promoted inbreeding (F IS = 0.141), reduced heterozygosity, and the loss of allelic richness. In contrast, a bottleneck identified in A. meeki is attributed to the rapid loss of allelic diversity; however, the R ST value and the BSP analysis (in the HPD range) indicates that the bottleneck detected by IAM were overestimated.

The population dynamics of A. meeki can be explained by the variations in nucleotide diversity and proportion of segregating sites (π < Θs), which is interpreted as a recent population reduction followed by expansion, as demonstrated by the estimated value of D T = -0.86 and non-significant positive values of Fu""s FS estimates [101][102][103]."	1	We estimated that the isolation of A. diazi from A. meeki occurred in the past 400-7000 years, which is consistent with geological, climatic, and anthropogenic events involving Pátzcuaro and Zirahuén lakes. Tecto-volcanic events giving rise to the separation of Pátzcuaro and Zirahuén lakes began 8000 years ago with the formation and activity of the La Tasa volcano southwest of Lake Pátzcuaro and climate fluctuations causing decline in water level and drying of streams [21,[90][91]#CITATION_TAG[93]. Fluctuations in the level of Lake Pátzcuaro during the Holocene associated with climate change, human activity [90,91,[94][95][96][97][98][99], and occurrence of tsunamis [100] could be involved to the isolation and demographics changes of A. diazi and A. meeki.

CCT227	The genus Allotoca is the most diverse within the Goodeinae, and is the subject of taxonomic controversy, with the need for taxonomic revision to validate species [9,10,[15][16]#CITATION_TAG. The A. diazi complex comprises three recognized species [5]: Allotoca diazi [18], endemic to Pátzcuaro basin, A. meeki [16], endemic in the Zirahuén basin, and Allotoca catarinae [15], restricted to the Cupatitzio River, an upper tributary of the Balsas River basin (Fig 1). Allotoca diazi was extirpated from Pátzcuaro Lake and is currently restricted to the Chapultepec Spring, a tributary of Pátzcuaro Lake, while A. meeki was extirpated from Zirahuén Lake and currently restricted to Opopeo Spring, a tributary of the Zirahuén Lake [5]. The lakes are located in the Michoacán-Guanajuato Corridor, an area of over 1000 volcanic cones active from the Pliocene to the present. To explain the evolution of these three sister species and other co-distributed taxa, two biogeographic hypotheses have been proposed. The first argues the existence of a tributary connecting the Lerma River with Cuitzeo, Pátzcuaro, and Zirahuén lakes [19] around 700 000 years ago [20]. The second hypothesis indicates the existence of a tributary connecting the Cupatitzio River with Zirahuén and Pátzcuaro lakes, reaching Zacapu [21].	0	The genus Allotoca is the most diverse within the Goodeinae, and is the subject of taxonomic controversy, with the need for taxonomic revision to validate species [9,10,[15][16]#CITATION_TAG.

CCT246	"We estimated that the isolation of A. diazi from A. meeki occurred in the past 400-7000 years, which is consistent with geological, climatic, and anthropogenic events involving Pátzcuaro and Zirahuén lakes. Tecto-volcanic events giving rise to the separation of Pátzcuaro and Zirahuén lakes began 8000 years ago with the formation and activity of the La Tasa volcano southwest of Lake Pátzcuaro and climate fluctuations causing decline in water level and drying of streams [21,[90][91][92][93]. Fluctuations in the level of Lake Pátzcuaro during the Holocene associated with climate change, human activity [90,91,[94][95][96][97][98][99], and occurrence of tsunamis [100] could be involved to the isolation and demographics changes of A. diazi and A. meeki. These demographic changes were reflected in genetic diversity including the positive D T value, which was found to be low in A. diazi, and associated with recent bottlenecks that promoted inbreeding (F IS = 0.141), reduced heterozygosity, and the loss of allelic richness. In contrast, a bottleneck identified in A. meeki is attributed to the rapid loss of allelic diversity; however, the R ST value and the BSP analysis (in the HPD range) indicates that the bottleneck detected by IAM were overestimated. The population dynamics of A. meeki can be explained by the variations in nucleotide diversity and proportion of segregating sites (π < Θs), which is interpreted as a recent population reduction followed by expansion, as demonstrated by the estimated value of D T = -0.86 and non-significant positive values of Fu""s FS estimates #CITATION_TAG[102][103]."	0	"Fluctuations in the level of Lake Pátzcuaro during the Holocene associated with climate change, human activity [90,91,[94][95][96][97][98][99], and occurrence of tsunamis [100] could be involved to the isolation and demographics changes of A. diazi and A. meeki.

CCT261	The resistance of ultradian rhythms to interventions which lengthen the period of free-running circadian rhythms, especially that of nocturnal ultradian rhythms , contrasts with the slowing of other biological timing processes, suggesting unique control mechanisms for generation of ultradian and circadian rhythms . There is evidence that brown adipose tissue may be a site of interaction between metabolic and circadian systems (van der Veen et al., 2012). It appears that a non-transcriptional pathway for the metabolic cycle engages the circadian clock, thereby enhancing clock performance (van Ooijen and Millar, 2012). Changes in the cellular metabolic state could be the cause, not just the result, of neuronal activity (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2012), and if this holds true, then the ultradian rhythms in brown adipose tissue may lead neuronal activity. Importantly, in support to this view, changes in the activity of brown adipose tissue can guide the overall maintenance of the circadian rhythm of core body temperature (Yang et al., 2011).	0	The resistance of ultradian rhythms to interventions which lengthen the period of free-running circadian rhythms, especially that of nocturnal ultradian rhythms , contrasts with the slowing of other biological timing processes, suggesting unique control mechanisms for generation of ultradian and circadian rhythms .

CCT282	It appears that in response to stressors, there may be a tendency for women to internalise emotions, possibly leading to withdrawal, anxiety and depression, while men may be more likely to externalise emotions, leading to aggressive, impulsive or antisocial behaviour (Eaton et al 2012). Gender differences in the prevalence of these conditions appear to relate to a complex array of influences rather than simple biological factors, and these differences interact with social markers such as education, income, housing tenure, employment, marital status and ethnicity (WHO 2012a). For example, although lower socio-economic status is associated with increased prevalence of common mental disorders, its influence may be more pronounced among men: those with the lowest household income in England were found to be three times more likely to have depression or an anxiety condition as those in the highest income households (23.5% and 8.8% respectively), while for women, household income appeared to have less of an influence on mental health (#CITATION_TAG et al 2009). Job insecurity and high levels of job strain have been identified as risk factors for depression (Wang et al 2012). Links have also been made between the economic recession and its effects on work and traditional roles, particularly in terms of increased likelihood of depression among men (Dunlop and Mletzko 2011).

CCT304	In temperate areas of North America and Europe, bog (peatland) vegetation is also rare, being naturally isolated and forming a low proportion of the natural landscape. Although often viewed as a long-lived successional stage between open water and forest in glaciated landscapes, peatlands can get reset to an earlier successional stage (Curtis 1959). Since bogs are well known for their relatively stable vegetations and insect faunas over the long term, they can also be viewed as a climax community (#CITATION_TAG et al. 1999;Spitzer and Danks 2006;Whitehouse 2006;Whitehouse et al. 2008). While often considered relatively uniform floristically both within and among sites, bogs actually contain many microhabitats (Väisänen 1992;Spitzer and Danks 2006;Turlure et al. 2009). In Wisconsin, bogs occur primarily in central and northern areas (Curtis 1959). Prior to European settlement, peatlands occurred in \\1% of the Wisconsin landscape (even counting only the northern third of the state), and most of that vegetation is still extant, with only 9% loss (Hoffman 2002), more lost in central than northern Wisconsin. Much of what is left, especially in northern Wisconsin, is relatively undegraded. Primary human impacts are roads and ditches; adjacent lands are more affected by timber harvesting, agriculture, and urbanization (pers. obs.). Conversion to cranberry agriculture and peat harvesting has occurred more in central Wisconsin bogs (Curtis 1959). By contrast, in Europe bog vegetation is much destroyed and degraded by human activities, along with the associated butterfly species of high conservation concern (Vandewoestijne and Baguette 2004;Schtickzelle et al. 2006;Spencer and Collins 2008;Turlure et al. 2009).

CCT308	But even if the climate sensitivity were known with little uncertainty, a problem arises in understanding the regional changes in climate, and that in turn involves the dynamical issue of understanding changes in the general circulation of the atmosphere. As a step toward that, our primary goal in this article is to better understand what changes in large-scale atmospheric structure are likely, or robust, as the planet warms. Our approach is two-fold. On the one hand, as an empirical tool we use the archive of coupled climate models used for the fifth assessment report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to assess the robustness of model responses to a given warming or given emissions scenario. In addition, we try to assess whether the response is consistent with or explainable by simple physical arguments, some of which have been presented in the literature before (see also the review by #CITATION_TAG et al., 2010). Our general point of view is that robustness is most assured if there is agreement across a range of comprehensive and idealized models and if there is a well understood physical argument that captures the phenomenon. We spend more time describing arguments that are clear and robust; thus we discuss the mechanism of an increase in tropopause height at some length but do not go into such detail regarding the various arguments for latitudinal shifts of the circulation.	1	As a step toward that, our primary goal in this article is to better understand what changes in large-scale atmospheric structure are likely, or robust, as the planet warms.

Although these data do include some information about the structural characteristics of the forest within the LiDAR footprints, canopy height is the principal parameter detected (Lefsky et al., 2005). However, allometric equations that relate physical attributes of trees to their above-ground biomass normally rely on three parameters: in addition to tree height (H), tree diameter at 1.3 m (D) and wood density (ρ) are very important (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2005), and mean values and ratios between these parameters vary significantly between regions (Chave et al., 2005;Feldpausch et al., 2012;Quesada et al., 2012), associated with different species communities (ter Steege et al., 2006). We know that wood density increases from west to east across Amazonia (Baker et al., 2004;ter Steege et al., 2006), inversely correlated to stem turnover rate (Quesada et al., 2012).

CCT315	Amazonia contains half of all remaining tropical moist forest (Fritz et al., 2003). The total vegetation carbon storage of Amazon basin tropical forests has been subject to a wide range of estimates (Houghton et al., 2001;Malhi et al., 2006;#CITATION_TAG et al., 2007). These have varied from 58 Pg C (Olson et al., 1983) to 134 Pg C (Fearnside, 1997, scaled to whole basin), although there is now some general consensus in the middle of this range [e.g. 93 ± 23 Pg C (Malhi et al., 2006), 86 ± 17 Pg C (Saatchi et al., 2007) and 89 Pg C (FAO, 2010)]. However, these estimates of carbon stocks mask large differences at a smaller spatial scale, as local variations are cancelled out when summing over large areas: the spatial patterns visible in different maps of above-ground biomass (AGB) vary greatly, with little consistency even between studies that use similar methods and input data (Houghton et al., 2001).	0	Amazonia contains half of all remaining tropical moist forest (Fritz et al., 2003).

CCT318	In both cases, the primary calibration data used to produce the maps is derived from profiles of tree height from the ICESat GLAS sensor. Although these data do include some information about the structural characteristics of the forest within the LiDAR footprints, canopy height is the principal parameter detected (Lefsky et al., 2005). However, allometric equations that relate physical attributes of trees to their above-ground biomass normally rely on three parameters: in addition to tree height (H), tree diameter at 1.3 m (D) and wood density (ρ) are very important (Chave et al., 2005), and mean values and ratios between these parameters vary significantly between regions (Chave et al., 2005;Feldpausch et al., 2012;Quesada et al., 2012), associated with different species communities (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2006).

CCT320	It is important to understand the drivers of the AGB gradient seen in the field plots. From an ecological point of view, AGB is ultimately a function of net primary production (NPP) and the turnover rate of the forest. Spatial differences in NPP and turnover rates are associated with different species with different life-history strategies and structures caused by different climatic conditions and the chemical and physical properties of the soil (Quesada et al., 2012), with these different floristic communities associated with different AGB values. The key ecological parameters associated with differing AGB are basal area, wood density and D:H ratios, all of which vary across the basin (Baker et al., 2004;ter Steege et al., 2006;#CITATION_TAG et al., 2012;Feldpausch et al., 2012;Quesada et al., 2012), but none of which is directly detected by RS. Mapping basal area and wood density from the plots shows that both increase from SW-NE, though wood density shows a larger proportional trend than basal area (Fig. 4a,c). It is also known that, in general, tropical South American trees are shorter for a given diameter than trees from other tropical regions (Banin et al., 2012), with the exception of the Guiana Shield where trees are comparatively tall for a given diameter, with D:H relationships statistically indistinguishable from the forests of Africa and Southeast Asia (Feldpausch et al., 2011). In order to assess the relative impact of wood density and tree height on AGB, we recalculated the AGB values of the 413 field plots using the same three-parameter allometric equations and diameter information, but applying three different approaches to the other two variables: 1 K Dρ: Using a pan-Amazonian D:H model rather than the four regional height models (Feldpausch et al., 2012), but the same wood density values as KDHρ; 2 KDH: Using a constant value of 0.63 as the wood density for every stem, but the regional height models as in KDHρ; 3 KD: Using a pan-Amazonian D:H model and a constant wood density value, but the same allometric equations, so AGB varied between plots solely due to D.	0	It is important to understand the drivers of the AGB gradient seen in the field plots.

CCT327	For a wide variety of conservation and sustainable forest management projects, forest carbon stocks -and changes in these stocks -must be estimated with confidence. Accurate estimation, however, still faces major challenges: indeed, in a comparison of estimates of carbon emissions from deforestation in the Amazon, the biggest cause of discrepancies between estimates was found to be due to carbon mapping, higher than the uncertainty in the mapping of deforestation (Gutierrez-Velez & Pontius, 2012). AGB is the largest carbon pool in most tropical forests, and also tends to be the best characterized because it is relatively easy to measure, with other carbon pools often estimated as a simple ratio of AGB (GOFC-GOLD, 2009). Biomass maps of the Amazon region have been created in a number of ways. Some have used direct extrapolations from field-plot measurements, either multiplying the total area of forest by mean biomass density values (Olson et al., 1983;Fearnside, 1997;FAO, 2010) or by two-dimensional kriging (Malhi et al., 2006); others have used environmental gradients to co-krig field-plot measurements (U.S. Agency for International Development, 2012); and others have used remotesensing (RS) data (Saatchi et al., 2007). In the absence of continuous field measurements throughout an area of interest, RS datasets should provide the most accurate maps, because every location can be directly observed.

The kriged map of the same field plots (Fig. 3c) shows that the latitudinal and longitudinal trends seen in the graphs are clearly driven by the dominant SW-NE gradient.

CCT331	Amazonia contains half of all remaining tropical moist forest (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2003). The total vegetation carbon storage of Amazon basin tropical forests has been subject to a wide range of estimates (Houghton et al., 2001;Malhi et al., 2006;Saatchi et al., 2007). These have varied from 58 Pg C (Olson et al., 1983) to 134 Pg C (Fearnside, 1997, scaled to whole basin), although there is now some general consensus in the middle of this range [e.g. 93 ± 23 Pg C (Malhi et al., 2006), 86 ± 17 Pg C (Saatchi et al., 2007) and 89 Pg C (FAO, 2010)]. However, these estimates of carbon stocks mask large differences at a smaller spatial scale, as local variations are cancelled out when summing over large areas: the spatial patterns visible in different maps of above-ground biomass (AGB) vary greatly, with little consistency even between studies that use similar methods and input data (Houghton et al., 2001).	0	Amazonia contains half of all remaining tropical moist forest (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2003).

CCT332	For a wide variety of conservation and sustainable forest management projects, forest carbon stocks -and changes in these stocks -must be estimated with confidence. Accurate estimation, however, still faces major challenges: indeed, in a comparison of estimates of carbon emissions from deforestation in the Amazon, the biggest cause of discrepancies between estimates was found to be due to carbon mapping, higher than the uncertainty in the mapping of deforestation (Gutierrez-Velez & Pontius, 2012). AGB is the largest carbon pool in most tropical forests, and also tends to be the best characterized because it is relatively easy to measure, with other carbon pools often estimated as a simple ratio of AGB (GOFC-GOLD, 2009). Biomass maps of the Amazon region have been created in a number of ways. Some have used direct extrapolations from field-plot measurements, either multiplying the total area of forest by mean biomass density values (Olson et al., 1983;#CITATION_TAG, 1997;FAO, 2010) or by two-dimensional kriging (Malhi et al., 2006); others have used environmental gradients to co-krig field-plot measurements (U.S. Agency for International Development, 2012); and others have used remotesensing (RS) data (Saatchi et al., 2007).

CCT335	In both cases, the primary calibration data used to produce the maps is derived from profiles of tree height from the ICESat GLAS sensor. Although these data do include some information about the structural characteristics of the forest within the LiDAR footprints, canopy height is the principal parameter detected (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2005). However, allometric equations that relate physical attributes of trees to their above-ground biomass normally rely on three parameters: in addition to tree height (H), tree diameter at 1.3 m (D) and wood density (ρ) are very important (Chave et al., 2005), and mean values and ratios between these parameters vary significantly between regions (Chave et al., 2005;Feldpausch et al., 2012;Quesada et al., 2012), associated with different species communities (ter Steege et al., 2006). We know that wood density increases from west to east across Amazonia (Baker et al., 2004;ter Steege et al., 2006), inversely correlated to stem turnover rate (Quesada et al., 2012). This gradient is driven by soil fertility, notably total soil phosphorus and the concentration of exchangeable potassium ions (Aragão et al., 2009), and especially by the physical qualities of the soil. Thus, the fertile but shallower soils of the western Amazon lead to higher productivity and faster turnover, and a set of species with low wood density; conversely, the low fertility but deep and freely-draining soils of the eastern Amazon tend to have lower productivity and slower turnover, and species with much higher wood density. The relationship between diameter and height also varies across the basin, but with more complexity than wood density, mostly related to climatic factors (Feldpausch et al., 2011). These are approximated into four zones (Feldpausch et al., 2011(Feldpausch et al., , 2012, with the use of a different D:H model in each zone, greatly reducing the error in the prediction of H from D compared to a pan-Amazonian model (Feldpausch et al., 2012).	0	In both cases, the primary calibration data used to produce the maps is derived from profiles of tree height from the ICESat GLAS sensor.

CCT368	"These EoSs describe the nuclear composition as a mix of free nucleons, α particles, and a representative heavy nucleus, whose mass and charge numbers depend on density, temperature, and neutronization of the matter.

CCT369	However, in a dynamical situation, as in the gain layer, where the matter is not at rest, the optical depth (which determines the interaction probability of a crossing neutrino) is not a perfectly appropriate measure for the heating efficiency. This statement holds in particular in the multidimensional case, wherein accretion funnels carry cold (low-entropy) matter from the shock toward the NS while neutrino-heated matter expands outward in high-entropy bubbles. At such conditions, the residence time of the matter in the gain layer accounts for the duration of its exposure to neutrino heating. Whereas in the 1D case the advection time t adv ∼ (R s − R g )/|v 1 | (where v = v 0 /β) measures how long the accretion flow requires to go from R s to R g (156,#CITATION_TAG), the dwell time in the gain region is better captured in the multidimensional situation by the more general expression (104, 106)	5	However, in a dynamical situation, as in the gain layer, where the matter is not at rest, the optical depth (which determines the interaction probability of a crossing neutrino) is not a perfectly appropriate measure for the heating efficiency.

CCT398	Within the context of 1 + 3 formalisms, there have been a number of studies of averaging and backreaction which focus principally on associated mathematical issues. These include the Ricci flow [43,[54][55]#CITATION_TAG, group averaging of the FLRW isometry group [57] and the characterization of constant mean (extrinsic) curvature (CMC) flows [58][59][60]. Such approaches might provide further insights into the general problem of averaging tensors.

CCT400	In proceeding to level (iv)-galaxy clusters-the fundamental issues become obviously nontrivial. Since many galaxy clusters are spherical in shape, there is a temptation to model them using the spherically symmetric dust Lemaître-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) solutions [13]#CITATION_TAG[15]. While LTB models have certainly been applied to structure formation [16,17], their applicability is constrained by the uniform spherical shell approximation remaining valid, without shell crossings or the growth of angular momentum perturbations. This is probably unrealistically constraining for the case of a generic collapse, and LTB models are most obviously applicable to expanding spherical voids [18] with ionic or molecular sized dust. If we consider virialized spherical clusters of galaxies, then there is no obvious reason for the LTB model to be applicable. In many galaxy clusters, the motion of individual galaxies may be close to radial-however, the phases of the galaxies relative to passage through the centre of the cluster are completely uncorrelated. Individual galaxies will pass close to the core of the cluster and emerge from the other side; at any instant, the number of galaxies moving out from the centre might be comparable to the number falling in. Thus, virialized galaxy clusters certainly do not have the symmetry of a spherically symmetric dust solution if the galaxies are to be identified as the dust.	0	In proceeding to level (iv)-galaxy clusters-the fundamental issues become obviously nontrivial.

CCT401	"In the foregoing literature, two central arguments have been employed to connect individuals"" memberships in voluntary associations and their civic attitudes (Wollebaek & Selle, 2007). The first rests on a self-selection argument stating that people with sufficiently ""prosocial"" characteristics are more likely to engage in society and join voluntary associations compared to people lacking such characteristics. As a result, individuals in voluntary associations display higher levels of desirable social attitudes simply because they selected themselves into such associations due to their pro-social attitudes (e.g., van Deth et al., 1999). The second view rests on a socialization argument and states that membership in voluntary associations induces a process of appropriating norms, attitudes, values and roles (e.g., Putnam, 2000). In this case, membership is expected to lead individuals to develop ""new"" values through interactions with co-members. 2 Given the importance of formal and informal institutions for governing people""s behaviour (e.g., North, 1990;Thelen, 1999) and earlier findings linking the institutional environment to the development of specific types of voluntary associations (e.g., Berman, 1997;Kääriäinen & Lehtonen, 2006;Schofer & Fourcade-Gourinchas, 2001), it is surprising that both lines of argument ignore the socio-political and institutional environment within which the individual and the association exist.

CCT411	"In the foregoing literature, two central arguments have been employed to connect individuals"" memberships in voluntary associations and their civic attitudes (Wollebaek & Selle, 2007). The first rests on a self-selection argument stating that people with sufficiently ""prosocial"" characteristics are more likely to engage in society and join voluntary associations compared to people lacking such characteristics. As a result, individuals in voluntary associations display higher levels of desirable social attitudes simply because they selected themselves into such associations due to their pro-social attitudes (e.g., van Deth et al., 1999). The second view rests on a socialization argument and states that membership in voluntary associations induces a process of appropriating norms, attitudes, values and roles (e.g., Putnam, 2000). In this case, membership is expected to lead individuals to develop ""new"" values through interactions with co-members. 2 Given the importance of formal and informal institutions for governing people""s behaviour (e.g., #CITATION_TAG, 1990;Thelen, 1999) and earlier findings linking the institutional environment to the development of specific types of voluntary associations (e.g., Berman, 1997;Kääriäinen & Lehtonen, 2006;Schofer & Fourcade-Gourinchas, 2001), it is surprising that both lines of argument ignore the socio-political and institutional environment within which the individual and the association exist.

The importance of this debate lies not only in establishing whether Western societies have become more individualistic over time and its citizens increasingly ""hunker down"" (to borrow the colloquialism introduced in this respect by Putnam, 2007), but also reflects the central role often attributed to civic engagement for the development and maintenance of democratic values, generalized trust, cooperative norms, racial and religious tolerance, and so on (e.g., Delhey & Newton, 2005;Li, Pickles, & Savage, 2005;Putnam, 2000;Terriquez, 2011). When civic engagement is intimately associated with a wide range of social values, its decline can be feared to provoke a concomitant decline throughout society in inter-personal trust, tolerance, cooperation and so on (Putnam, 2000).

Exactly for this reason, political leaders in, for instance, the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and the European Union have in recent years shown a strong interest in stimulating civic engagement as a means to (help) address societal changes induced by, for instance, large-scale migration and globalization. To give only one example from the United Kingdom, the Conservative Party""s election manifesto for the May 2010 general election stated that the restoration of the United Kingdom""s social fabric and citizen involvement was a top priority.

When the relative importance of both these characteristics of voluntary associations for trust changes over time, reduced importance of one dimension may show up in an analysis focusing on this dimension, while the strengthening of the other is not picked up. Circumstantial, though suggestive, evidence of such an effect was recently presented in #CITATION_TAG and Murdoch (2010). They not only propose a simple procedure to integrate both approaches (i.e., connectedness/isolatedness and socio-demographic make-up of associations), but, crucially, illustrate that this combined measure generates more consistent empirical results using two distinct datasets from Flanders and the UK. Although the limited country-level sample sizes in WVS unfortunately do not allow evaluating to what extent a similar effect plays here, exploiting the often larger sample-size in country-specific surveys (such as the German and Swiss Freiwilligensurveys (volunteering surveys) or the US Social Capital Community Survey) may help remedy this in future work. Notes 1. While several scholars have admittedly employed time-series cross-section data, such studies have failed to exploit the time dimension present in their data. Rather, one coefficient estimate is provided for the entire sample, implicitly assuming that this reflects the (stable) engagement-values connection across both space and time. 2. Some scholars have argued that both effects are simultaneously at work -leading to a process where, say, some level of social trust is required to join, and joining subsequently reinfo rces trust (e.g., Brehm & Rahn, 1997). 3. Castells (1997 similarly argues that whoever constructs a collective identity determines the symbolic meaning of this identity for those identifying with it, and those placing themselves outside of it. As such, the formation of a collective (or group) identity directly shapes the identification processes relative to this group. 4. For instance, in the aftermath of the 9.0 earthquake and ensuing tsunami and nuclear crisis in Japan, the demand for weddings increased as people were ""jolted into adjusting priorities in l ife"" (Jiang, 2011). Similarly, the 9/11 attack on the New York World Trade Centre, and the subsequent 2004 Madrid and 2005 London bombings had a significant impact on ""the thoughts, feelings and behaviors of ind ividuals"" (Woods, 2011, p. 214; see also Best, Krueger, & Ladewig, 2006;Colás, 2010;Huddy, Khatib, & Capelos, 2002;Li & Brewer, 2004;Panagopoulos, 2006;Verkasalo, Goodwin, & Bezmenova, 2006;Yum & Schenck-Hamlin, 2005). 5.

Clearly, this is less than ideal, given that people may take time off from study and return to it later on. We experimented with trunc ating the education variable at age 21 (in line with Paxton, 2007), but this made no difference to our findings. Hence, we decided to report only the results with the untruncated education variable. Unfortunately, more direct measures such as an individual""s highest degree are unavailable in the WVS. 7. Note that we implicitly conflate the number of respondents in WVS claiming membership in a given type of association with the actual size of a real association of this type (i.e., the ideal data for the present analysis; see also Coffé & Geys, 2007, 2008. While this is clearly incorrect, the assumptions necessary for nonetheless applying this correction to our data are that a) observed membership sizes of association types in WVS tell us something about the relative sizes of real associations of different types and b) multiple memberships observed in WVS approximate the extent of connections between real groups of different association types. Both these critical assumptions are evidently also required to employ the original measure proposed in Paxton (2002Paxton ( , 2007."	5	Finally, we should point out that the connectedness measure employed in this article only regards connections between groups, and ignores those within associations (a differentiation of association types based exclusively on the socio-demographic composition of association membership is presented in Stolle & Rochon, 1998;Coffé & Geys, 2007).

CCT431	"Over the past decade, a lively debate has developed regarding the decline in civic participation observed by some, but not by others, across a number of Western democracies (#CITATION_TAG & van den Broek, 2005;Listhaug & Grønflaten, 2007;Paxton, 1999;Putnam, 2000;Stolle & Hooghe, 2003). The importance of this debate lies not only in establishing whether Western societies have become more individualistic over time and its citizens increasingly ""hunker down"" (to borrow the colloquialism introduced in this respect by Putnam, 2007), but also reflects the central role often attributed to civic engagement for the development and maintenance of democratic values, generalized trust, cooperative norms, racial and religious tolerance, and so on (e.g., Delhey & Newton, 2005;Li, Pickles, & Savage, 2005;Putnam, 2000;Terriquez, 2011). When civic engagement is intimately associated with a wide range of social values, its decline can be feared to provoke a concomitant decline throughout society in inter-personal trust, tolerance, cooperation and so on (Putnam, 2000). Conversely, however, a close engagement-values relation also holds significant promise, especially to politicians, as it would imply that policies to stimulate civic engagement can become reflected in a parallel change in social and democratic values. Exactly for this reason, political leaders in, for instance, the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and the European Union have in recent years shown a strong interest in stimulating civic engagement as a means to (help) address societal changes induced by, for instance, large-scale migration and globalization. To give only one example from the United Kingdom, the Conservative Party""s election manifesto for the May 2010 general election stated that the restoration of the United Kingdom""s social fabric and citizen involvement was a top priority. After the election, David Cameron again stressed this point in his first speech as Prime Minister."	0	"Over the past decade, a lively debate has developed regarding the decline in civic participation observed by some, but not by others, across a number of Western democracies (#CITATION_TAG & van den Broek, 2005;Listhaug & Grønflaten, 2007;Paxton, 1999;Putnam, 2000;Stolle & Hooghe, 2003).

CCT432	"For civic engagement to act as a ""school for democracy citizen""s engagement should be coupled with a positive engagement-values relation. Both elements are mutually conditional in the sense that they are jointly necessary to obtain the desired outcome (#CITATION_TAG, Newton, & Welzel, 2011;Goertz, 2006). Whereas significant research has previously studied the presence/absence of inter-temporal shifts in civic engagement across Western democracies (Paxton, 1999;Putnam, 2000;Stolle & Hooghe, 2003), similar debates regarding the existence and/or drivers of inter-temporal shifts in the engagement-values relation have been much slower to emerge. This article took a first step to bridge this gap. Specifically, we argued that changes in the broader institutional environment within which such engagement takes place can induce alterations in the engagementvalues relation. In support of this theoretical proposition, empirical evidence from the 1990 and 2000 waves of the WVS illustrates the temporal instability of the engagement-values relation. Particularly, the empirical support for the idea that memberships in connected associations are better than in isolated associations has become weaker in more recent years. While voluntary association memberships are positively associated with generalized trust in both the 1990 and 2000 wave of WVS, memberships in connected voluntary associations no longer seem equally beneficial for generalized trust than memberships in isolated associations in 2000 than they were in 1990."	0	"For civic engagement to act as a ""school for democracy citizen""s engagement should be coupled with a positive engagement-values relation.

CCT435	"Finally, we should point out that the connectedness measure employed in this article only regards connections between groups, and ignores those within associations (a differentiation of association types based exclusively on the socio-demographic composition of association membership is presented in Stolle & Rochon, 1998;Coffé & Geys, 2007). When the relative importance of both these characteristics of voluntary associations for trust changes over time, reduced importance of one dimension may show up in an analysis focusing on this dimension, while the strengthening of the other is not picked up. Circumstantial, though suggestive, evidence of such an effect was recently presented in Geys and Murdoch (2010). They not only propose a simple procedure to integrate both approaches (i.e., connectedness/isolatedness and socio-demographic make-up of associations), but, crucially, illustrate that this combined measure generates more consistent empirical results using two distinct datasets from Flanders and the UK. Although the limited country-level sample sizes in WVS unfortunately do not allow evaluating to what extent a similar effect plays here, exploiting the often larger sample-size in country-specific surveys (such as the German and Swiss Freiwilligensurveys (volunteering surveys) or the US Social Capital Community Survey) may help remedy this in future work. Notes 1. While several scholars have admittedly employed time-series cross-section data, such studies have failed to exploit the time dimension present in their data. Rather, one coefficient estimate is provided for the entire sample, implicitly assuming that this reflects the (stable) engagement-values connection across both space and time. 2. Some scholars have argued that both effects are simultaneously at work -leading to a process where, say, some level of social trust is required to join, and joining subsequently reinfo rces trust (e.g., Brehm & Rahn, 1997). 3. Castells (1997 similarly argues that whoever constructs a collective identity determines the symbolic meaning of this identity for those identifying with it, and those placing themselves outside of it. As such, the formation of a collective (or group) identity directly shapes the identification processes relative to this group. 4. For instance, in the aftermath of the 9.0 earthquake and ensuing tsunami and nuclear crisis in Japan, the demand for weddings increased as people were ""jolted into adjusting priorities in l ife"" (#CITATION_TAG, 2011). Similarly, the 9/11 attack on the New York World Trade Centre, and the subsequent 2004 Madrid and 2005 London bombings had a significant impact on ""the thoughts, feelings and behaviors of ind ividuals"" (Woods, 2011, p. 214; see also Best, Krueger, & Ladewig, 2006;Colás, 2010;Huddy, Khatib, & Capelos, 2002;Li & Brewer, 2004;Panagopoulos, 2006;Verkasalo, Goodwin, & Bezmenova, 2006;Yum & Schenck-Hamlin, 2005). 5.

Clearly, this is less than ideal, given that people may take time off from study and return to it later on. We experimented with trunc ating the education variable at age 21 (in line with Paxton, 2007), but this made no difference to our findings. Hence, we decided to report only the results with the untruncated education variable. Unfortunately, more direct measures such as an individual""s highest degree are unavailable in the WVS. 7. Note that we implicitly conflate the number of respondents in WVS claiming membership in a given type of association with the actual size of a real association of this type (i.e., the ideal data for the present analysis; see also Coffé & Geys, 2007, 2008. While this is clearly incorrect, the assumptions necessary for nonetheless applying this correction to our data are that a) observed membership sizes of association types in WVS tell us something about the relative sizes of real associations of different types and b) multiple memberships observed in WVS approximate the extent of connections between real groups of different association types. Both these critical assumptions are evidently also required to employ the original measure proposed in Paxton (2002Paxton ( , 2007."	0	"Castells (1997 similarly argues that whoever constructs a collective identity determines the symbolic meaning of this identity for those identifying with it, and those placing themselves outside of it.

We first assessed whether ring-necked parakeet climatic niches differed significantly between phylogroups (i.e. Africa versus Asian, and phylogroups within each continent), using all biomes occupied by parakeets across their native range as background area (Guisan et al., 2014). Second, native and invasive ring-necked parakeet occurrences were used to assess whether native niche characteristics are conserved during the invasion process (using a niche similarity test), and to determine whether parakeets have colonized in the invaded range climates not occupied in the native range (i.e. niche expansion, Petitpierre et al., 2012). Niche metrics are calculated on the climate space shared by native and invasive ranges (sensu Petitpierre et al., 2012). Background areas should reflect the set of areas a species could potentially have encountered since its presence in the region (Barve et al., 2011). Therefore, in Europe, we buffered each locality where parakeets have been introduced with a distance equal to the minimum invasion speed recorded for birds (i.e. 4.59 km year À1 , derived from #CITATION_TAG et al., 2009) multiplied by the number of years since introduction (see Strubbe et al., 2013 for details).

Erroneous predictions of the potential distribution of invasive species are often attributed to species adaptations in response to selection pressures imposed by the novel environment (Whitney & Gabler, 2008). However, within the native range, species may also evolve pre-adaptations to invasiveness; strong selection imposed by human modification of habitats within the native range is likely to lead to adaptation prior to introduction elsewhere (Hufbauer et al., 2012). As human activities tend to promote similar ecological conditions across biogeographical areas (Savard et al., 2000), species or populations associated with human-modified habitats in the native range can be expected to successfully invade similar areas elsewhere. It is therefore surprising that predic-tions of invasion risk obtained from bioclimatic envelope models have not yet explicitly considered how human modification of habitats might modify distributional limits set by climate."	0	"Therefore, we assess three key assumptions underlying bioclimatic envelope models: (1) that species"" distributions are largely governed by climate (Ara ujo & Peterson, 2012), (2) that a species"" current native distribution corresponds with the total set of climate conditions under which it can persist (#CITATION_TAG, 2003) and (3) that the climatic niche remains conserved across time and space (Broennimann et al., 2007).

CCT453	"Here, using a unique dataset on the distribution of a global avian invader, the ring-necked parakeet (Psittacula krameri), we test whether accounting for within-taxon niche structure and association with humans in the native range leads to more accurate predictions of invasion risk. Ringnecked parakeets are native to large parts of Africa and Asia. Across their native range, they have benefited from the conversion of natural habitats to agro-ecosystems (Bruggers & Beck, 1979;Khan, 2002) and reach their highest breeding densities near human settlements and cultivated crops (Khan et al., 2004). These parakeets are a globally widespread invasive species, and they compete with native birds and bats and cause damage to crops (Strubbe & Matthysen, 2009a;Hern andez-Brito et al., 2014;#CITATION_TAG et al., 2014). In this study, we present the most complete information on the distribution of ring-necked parakeets to date, comprising a set of about 1200 (686 native and 513 invasive) occurrences collected at a finer resolution than has previously been reported, 123 failed and successful introduction events across Europe, plus a high-resolution mtDNA molecular phylogeny derived from 98 museum specimens geospatially selected to cover the parakeet""s native range and from feather samples collected at 13 invaded sites across Europe. We expect that incorporating within-taxon niche structure into bioclimatic envelope models will result in important differences in the geographical distribution of climate predicted as suitable for parakeets across Europe and that accounting for association with human-modified habitats in the native range will allow for more accurate predictions of the potential European distribution of this ubiquitous avian invader."	0	"Here, using a unique dataset on the distribution of a global avian invader, the ring-necked parakeet (Psittacula krameri), we test whether accounting for within-taxon niche structure and association with humans in the native range leads to more accurate predictions of invasion risk.

Across their native range, they have benefited from the conversion of natural habitats to agro-ecosystems (Bruggers & Beck, 1979;Khan, 2002) and reach their highest breeding densities near human settlements and cultivated crops (Khan et al., 2004). These parakeets are a globally widespread invasive species, and they compete with native birds and bats and cause damage to crops (Strubbe & Matthysen, 2009a;Hern andez-Brito et al., 2014;#CITATION_TAG et al., 2014). In this study, we present the most complete information on the distribution of ring-necked parakeets to date, comprising a set of about 1200 (686 native and 513 invasive) occurrences collected at a finer resolution than has previously been reported, 123 failed and successful introduction events across Europe, plus a high-resolution mtDNA molecular phylogeny derived from 98 museum specimens geospatially selected to cover the parakeet""s native range and from feather samples collected at 13 invaded sites across Europe. We expect that incorporating within-taxon niche structure into bioclimatic envelope models will result in important differences in the geographical distribution of climate predicted as suitable for parakeets across Europe and that accounting for association with human-modified habitats in the native range will allow for more accurate predictions of the potential European distribution of this ubiquitous avian invader."	s
CCT454	Biological invasions are a major global environmental and economic problem (Sala et al., 2000). As eradication is frequently costly and sometimes impossible, attempting to limit the further introduction and spread of invasive species is the most effective and cost-efficient management strategy (Leung et al., 2002). To identify potentially invasive species, risk assessment protocols based on species traits associated with invasiveness have been developed (Keller et al., 2011). Spatially explicit predictions of invasion risk derived from bioclimatic envelope models [also referred to as species distribution models (SDM) or ecological niche models (ENM)] calibrated with native species distributions are increasingly incorporated into such invasive species risk assessments (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2014). To assess potential invasion risk, bioclimatic envelope models estimate the geographical distribution of climates suitable for invasive species (Ara ujo & Peterson, 2012). Applications of these models to invasive species, however, fail to consider how association with human-modified habitats in the native range, a species trait strongly associated with invasion success (Keller et al., 2011), might modify the distributional limits sets by climate. Also, models typically do not appreciate how the existence of phylogeographic lineages with differing niche requirements can influence forecasts of invasion risk (Pearman et al., 2010). Ignoring these factors may result in mismatches between predicted potential and realized invasive distributions, fuelling doubts about the suitability of bioclimatic envelope models for anticipating biological invasions (Guisan et al., 2014).	0	Biological invasions are a major global environmental and economic problem (Sala et al., 2000).

CCT455	"The fact that lineages associated with cold climates in the native range are more prevalent across Europe suggests that these lineages may be better adapted to European climates. Such an invasion scenario has been found before; for example, #CITATION_TAG et al. (2012) showed that the invasion of Mediterranean Israel by the tropical ant Wasmannia auropunctata could be explained by adaptation to cold at the southern limit of the native range before introduction to Israel. Yet, although large numbers of parakeets from both Africa and Asia have been imported to Europe (Morgan, 1993), more detailed knowledge on propagule pressure is required to rule out alternative explanations such as the possibility that more birds originating from colder parts of the native rang have escaped or been released across Europe. Also, it should be noted that our phylogeny is based on a set of neutral genetic markers and that consequently, patterns of within-taxon niche variation may be due to regional differences in available climates, to adaptation to local environments or to other drivers such as biotic interactions. However, populations are often adapted to local environments and genotypeby-environment interactions are common in widespread species (Pearman et al., 2010). This study is the first fine-scale assessment of ring-necked parakeet genetic structure, but differences among lineages in morphology and life history traits such as timing of reproduction have been reported within and between Africa and Asia (Forshaw, 1978). Such traits may be genetically based and therefore likely to respond to selection (Bradshaw & Holzapfel, 2006) in the parakeet""s invasive range. Indeed, variance in laying dates between European and native (Asian) parakeet populations suggests that in Europe, parakeets are delaying their breeding in response to colder temperatures (Shwartz et al., 2009). These differences in morphology, life history and occupied climates suggest parakeet mtDNA-derived lineages may indeed diverge in features supplementary to the neutral genetic markers used to identify phylogeographic structure. Our results thus suggest the clade model captures lineage-specific responses to environmental gradients that are undetectable using the clade model (Appendix S8). Incorporating such within-taxon niche structure into bioclimatic envelope models only slightly increased model predictive accuracy, but nonetheless leads to important differences in spatial predictions of invasion risk for Europe (Figs 2 & 3). The climate-only clade model is strongly influenced by precipitation gradients (Appendix S8), resulting in erroneous predictions of parakeet occurrence for Europe""s wetter areas (i.e. parts of the Atlantic and Adriatic coast, and along mountain chains, Fig. 2a). The climate-only subclade model indicates certain phylogeographic lineages indeed respond strongly to precipitation gradients (Appendix S8), although in general, the subclade model is more strongly driven by temperature gradients. The climate-only subclade model accordingly correctly predicts some of the Mediterranean parakeet populations, and except for a high precipitation zone along the coast of Norway, it assigns a low invasion risk to coastal areas and mountain chains (Fig. 2b). Both climate-only models, however, fail to accurately forecast ringnecked parakeet occurrence across north-west Europe. When including the human footprint, the major difference between the clade and subclade model is that the latter places more weight on temperature and precipitation gradients (Appendix S8), whereas the clade model exhibits a higher dependency on human footprint. Consequently, the clade model predicts a higher invasion risk across human-dominated habitats in colder parts of continental Europe (Fig. 2c, d) as well. This becomes especially apparent when converting the predictions of invasion risk into discrete predictions of parakeet presence and absence (Fig. 3), showing that particularly in east and central Europe, the clade model predicts as suitable areas that are geographically peripheral to areas predicted as suitable by the subclade model. In contrast, in southern Europe, the subclade model predicts more extensive areas to be at risk of parakeet invasion, reflecting the different weightings given by the clade and subclade model to climate and human modification of habitats."	0	The fact that lineages associated with cold climates in the native range are more prevalent across Europe suggests that these lineages may be better adapted to European climates.

Niche theory indeed predicts that for relatively recent events such as biological invasions, conservatism of the fundamental native niche is expected (#CITATION_TAG, 2011), although species may, in the invaded range, occupy different portions of their fundamental niche compared to the native range (Guisan et al., 2014). Empirical studies on the prevalence of (realized) niche conservatism have yielded mixed results. Two large scale studies on European plants introduced to North America found niche conservatism was the dominant pattern for weedy, widespread plant species (Petitpierre et al., 2012), while niche expansion into climates not occupied in the native range was common for plants with smaller native ranges (Early & Sax, 2014).

To better understand the mechanisms underlying patterns of niche conservatism, here, we question the inherent assumption that pooling occurrence data from across the entire native range of a species adequately describes the full range of climatic conditions in which invasive populations can establish and survive. This assumption may be violated when phylogeographic lineages with differing niche requirements are present. Species may not represent a single evolutionary entity (Pearman et al., 2010), and as species-level models smooth across environmental response curves of specific lineages, ignoring within-taxon niche structure risks erroneous predictions of a species"" potential distribution (D""Amen et al., 2013).

CCT459	"Given its strong effect on the accuracy of predictions of invasion risk, incorporating information on association with human-modified habitats in the native range should be integrated into bioclimatic envelope models, if they are to effectively guide invasive species management. Association with human-modified habitats in the native range may enable ringnecked parakeets to exploit equivalent human-modified landscapes in Europe, allowing them to colonize areas far colder than their native range. Ring-necked parakeets have almost 90% of their invasive distribution outside their native climatic niche (Fig. 1), and this is among the highest values of niche expansion known for vertebrates (Strubbe et al., 2013;Li et al., 2014). Previous studies suggest niche expansion into climates not occupied in the native range is more likely for species with small native ranges (plants, Early & Sax, 2014;amphibians and reptiles, Li et al., 2014), for species introduced longer ago or that have invaded areas located at lower latitudes than the native range (amphibians and reptiles, Early & Sax, 2014). Ring-necked parakeets, however, have a very large native range and have been introduced relatively recent (most European introductions stem from after 1970, Strubbe & Matthysen, 2009b) to much higher latitudes than their native range. Our results thus identify, for the first time, association with humans in the native range as a factor influencing climatic niche expansion during biological invasion. Climate influences species distributions directly through species"" physiological tolerances or indirectly through its effect on available habitats, food resources and biotic interactions such as the presence of competitors (Ara ujo & Peterson, 2012, Wisz et al. 2013. The fact that ring-necked parakeets thrive in Europe suggests they may be physiologically capable of colonizing colder parts of the climate space in their native range as well. Possibly, a lack of resources and/or competition with congeneric species such as slaty-headed (P. himalayana) and Lord Derby""s Parakeet (P. derbiana) restricts the ring-necked parakeets"" native northernmost distribution limits. Indeed, endotherms such as birds are often able to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, but this comes at a potentially high energetic cost (#CITATION_TAG & Kearney, 2009). In Europe, radio-tracking (Clergeau & Vergnes, 2011;Strubbe & Matthysen, 2011) and habitat selection studies (Strubbe & Matthysen, 2007;Newson et al., 2010) indicate that parakeets prefer to forage in city parks and gardens, where bird feeders and ornamental vegetation present parakeets with abundant food. Urban areas also offer an Figure 3 Predictions of invasion risk for ring-necked parakeet in Europe derived from bioclimatic envelope models including association with human-modified habitats in the native range. Continuous model outputs (Fig. 2) were converted to binary predictions of invasion risk. Areas at risk according to both models without (see Fig. 2c) and with (see Fig. 2d) phylogeographic structure are indicated in red. Green indicates predicted parakeet presence only by a model without phylogeographic structure. Yellow delineates areas only marked as suitable by a model with phylogeographic structure. abundance of suitable nesting sites, as large, old trees are often retained for their aesthetic value. In the colder parts of Europe, parakeets increasingly breed in holes and crevices within the thermal insulation layers of buildings; in Germany, for example, such a more favourable microclimate enables them to achieve a higher breeding success compared to natural cavities (Braun, 2007). Moreover, in urban gardens, parakeets have been shown to be behaviourally dominant over native birds during foraging (Peck et al., 2014). Abundant resources and a lack of competitors may underlie the invasion success of ringnecked parakeets in environments far removed from their native (realized) niche. Yet, to elucidate the extent to which thermal and energetic constraints influence ring-necked parakeet distributional limits in their native versus non-native ranges, mechanistic niche models (which use species"" functional traits and physiological tolerances for model fitting, Kearney et al., 2010) are required. Furthermore, although little is known about interactions between Psittacula species in their native range, the hypothesis of competitive release as an underlying driver of ring-necked parakeet invasion success in Europe may be tested by assessing whether predicted geographical distribution patterns across the native range (derived from bioclimatic models) match expectations under competitive exclusion (sensu Guti errez et al., 2014)."	0	"Possibly, a lack of resources and/or competition with congeneric species such as slaty-headed (P. himalayana) and Lord Derby""s Parakeet (P. derbiana) restricts the ring-necked parakeets"" native northernmost distribution limits.

CCT460	"Therefore, we assess three key assumptions underlying bioclimatic envelope models: (1) that species"" distributions are largely governed by climate (Ara ujo & Peterson, 2012), (2) that a species"" current native distribution corresponds with the total set of climate conditions under which it can persist (Peterson, 2003) and (3) that the climatic niche remains conserved across time and space (Broennimann et al., 2007). Climate is generally recognized as a chief driver of species"" distributions at large spatial scales (Ara ujo & Peterson, 2012), although the broad distributional limits governed by climate may be modified by factors such as habitat availability, biotic interactions and dispersal limitations (Soberon, 2007). Erroneous predictions of the potential distribution of invasive species are often attributed to species adaptations in response to selection pressures imposed by the novel environment (Whitney & Gabler, 2008). However, within the native range, species may also evolve pre-adaptations to invasiveness; strong selection imposed by human modification of habitats within the native range is likely to lead to adaptation prior to introduction elsewhere (Hufbauer et al., 2012). As human activities tend to promote similar ecological conditions across biogeographical areas (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2000), species or populations associated with human-modified habitats in the native range can be expected to successfully invade similar areas elsewhere.

When including the human footprint, the major difference between the clade and subclade model is that the latter places more weight on temperature and precipitation gradients (Appendix S8), whereas the clade model exhibits a higher dependency on human footprint. Consequently, the clade model predicts a higher invasion risk across human-dominated habitats in colder parts of continental Europe (Fig. 2c, d) as well. This becomes especially apparent when converting the predictions of invasion risk into discrete predictions of parakeet presence and absence (Fig. 3), showing that particularly in east and central Europe, the clade model predicts as suitable areas that are geographically peripheral to areas predicted as suitable by the subclade model. In contrast, in southern Europe, the subclade model predicts more extensive areas to be at risk of parakeet invasion, reflecting the different weightings given by the clade and subclade model to climate and human modification of habitats."	0	The fact that lineages associated with cold climates in the native range are more prevalent across Europe suggests that these lineages may be better adapted to European climates. Such an invasion scenario has been found before; for example, Rey et al.

Yet, although large numbers of parakeets from both Africa and Asia have been imported to Europe (#CITATION_TAG, 1993), more detailed knowledge on propagule pressure is required to rule out alternative explanations such as the possibility that more birds originating from colder parts of the native rang have escaped or been released across Europe. Also, it should be noted that our phylogeny is based on a set of neutral genetic markers and that consequently, patterns of within-taxon niche variation may be due to regional differences in available climates, to adaptation to local environments or to other drivers such as biotic interactions. However, populations are often adapted to local environments and genotypeby-environment interactions are common in widespread species (Pearman et al., 2010). This study is the first fine-scale assessment of ring-necked parakeet genetic structure, but differences among lineages in morphology and life history traits such as timing of reproduction have been reported within and between Africa and Asia (Forshaw, 1978).	t

Such traits may be genetically based and therefore likely to respond to selection (Bradshaw & Holzapfel, 2006) in the parakeet""s invasive range. Indeed, variance in laying dates between European and native (Asian) parakeet populations suggests that in Europe, parakeets are delaying their breeding in response to colder temperatures (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2009). These differences in morphology, life history and occupied climates suggest parakeet mtDNA-derived lineages may indeed diverge in features supplementary to the neutral genetic markers used to identify phylogeographic structure. Our results thus suggest the clade model captures lineage-specific responses to environmental gradients that are undetectable using the clade model (Appendix S8). Incorporating such within-taxon niche structure into bioclimatic envelope models only slightly increased model predictive accuracy, but nonetheless leads to important differences in spatial predictions of invasion risk for Europe (Figs 2 & 3). The climate-only clade model is strongly influenced by precipitation gradients (Appendix S8), resulting in erroneous predictions of parakeet occurrence for Europe""s wetter areas (i.e. parts of the Atlantic and Adriatic coast, and along mountain chains, Fig. 2a). The climate-only subclade model indicates certain phylogeographic lineages indeed respond strongly to precipitation gradients (Appendix S8), although in general, the subclade model is more strongly driven by temperature gradients.

CCT465	"Therefore, we assess three key assumptions underlying bioclimatic envelope models: (1) that species"" distributions are largely governed by climate (Ara ujo & Peterson, 2012), (2) that a species"" current native distribution corresponds with the total set of climate conditions under which it can persist (Peterson, 2003) and (3) that the climatic niche remains conserved across time and space (Broennimann et al., 2007). Climate is generally recognized as a chief driver of species"" distributions at large spatial scales (Ara ujo & Peterson, 2012), although the broad distributional limits governed by climate may be modified by factors such as habitat availability, biotic interactions and dispersal limitations (#CITATION_TAG, 2007). Erroneous predictions of the potential distribution of invasive species are often attributed to species adaptations in response to selection pressures imposed by the novel environment (Whitney & Gabler, 2008).

CCT466	"Given its strong effect on the accuracy of predictions of invasion risk, incorporating information on association with human-modified habitats in the native range should be integrated into bioclimatic envelope models, if they are to effectively guide invasive species management. Association with human-modified habitats in the native range may enable ringnecked parakeets to exploit equivalent human-modified landscapes in Europe, allowing them to colonize areas far colder than their native range. Ring-necked parakeets have almost 90% of their invasive distribution outside their native climatic niche (Fig. 1), and this is among the highest values of niche expansion known for vertebrates (Strubbe et al., 2013;Li et al., 2014). Previous studies suggest niche expansion into climates not occupied in the native range is more likely for species with small native ranges (plants, Early & Sax, 2014;amphibians and reptiles, Li et al., 2014), for species introduced longer ago or that have invaded areas located at lower latitudes than the native range (amphibians and reptiles, Early & Sax, 2014). Ring-necked parakeets, however, have a very large native range and have been introduced relatively recent (most European introductions stem from after 1970, Strubbe & Matthysen, 2009b) to much higher latitudes than their native range. Our results thus identify, for the first time, association with humans in the native range as a factor influencing climatic niche expansion during biological invasion. Climate influences species distributions directly through species"" physiological tolerances or indirectly through its effect on available habitats, food resources and biotic interactions such as the presence of competitors (Ara ujo & Peterson, 2012, Wisz et al. 2013. The fact that ring-necked parakeets thrive in Europe suggests they may be physiologically capable of colonizing colder parts of the climate space in their native range as well. Possibly, a lack of resources and/or competition with congeneric species such as slaty-headed (P. himalayana) and Lord Derby""s Parakeet (P. derbiana) restricts the ring-necked parakeets"" native northernmost distribution limits. Indeed, endotherms such as birds are often able to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, but this comes at a potentially high energetic cost (Porter & Kearney, 2009). In Europe, radio-tracking (Clergeau & Vergnes, 2011;Strubbe & Matthysen, 2011) and habitat selection studies (#CITATION_TAG & Matthysen, 2007;Newson et al., 2010) indicate that parakeets prefer to forage in city parks and gardens, where bird feeders and ornamental vegetation present parakeets with abundant food. Urban areas also offer an Figure 3 Predictions of invasion risk for ring-necked parakeet in Europe derived from bioclimatic envelope models including association with human-modified habitats in the native range.

Areas at risk according to both models without (see Fig. 2c) and with (see Fig. 2d) phylogeographic structure are indicated in red. Green indicates predicted parakeet presence only by a model without phylogeographic structure. Yellow delineates areas only marked as suitable by a model with phylogeographic structure. abundance of suitable nesting sites, as large, old trees are often retained for their aesthetic value. In the colder parts of Europe, parakeets increasingly breed in holes and crevices within the thermal insulation layers of buildings; in Germany, for example, such a more favourable microclimate enables them to achieve a higher breeding success compared to natural cavities (Braun, 2007). Moreover, in urban gardens, parakeets have been shown to be behaviourally dominant over native birds during foraging (Peck et al., 2014). Abundant resources and a lack of competitors may underlie the invasion success of ringnecked parakeets in environments far removed from their native (realized) niche. Yet, to elucidate the extent to which thermal and energetic constraints influence ring-necked parakeet distributional limits in their native versus non-native ranges, mechanistic niche models (which use species"" functional traits and physiological tolerances for model fitting, Kearney et al., 2010) are required. Furthermore, although little is known about interactions between Psittacula species in their native range, the hypothesis of competitive release as an underlying driver of ring-necked parakeet invasion success in Europe may be tested by assessing whether predicted geographical distribution patterns across the native range (derived from bioclimatic models) match expectations under competitive exclusion (sensu Guti errez et al., 2014)."	0	"himalayana) and Lord Derby""s Parakeet (P. derbiana) restricts the ring-necked parakeets"" native northernmost distribution limits.

CCT467	"Here, using a unique dataset on the distribution of a global avian invader, the ring-necked parakeet (Psittacula krameri), we test whether accounting for within-taxon niche structure and association with humans in the native range leads to more accurate predictions of invasion risk. Ringnecked parakeets are native to large parts of Africa and Asia. Across their native range, they have benefited from the conversion of natural habitats to agro-ecosystems (Bruggers & Beck, 1979;Khan, 2002) and reach their highest breeding densities near human settlements and cultivated crops (Khan et al., 2004). These parakeets are a globally widespread invasive species, and they compete with native birds and bats and cause damage to crops (#CITATION_TAG & Matthysen, 2009a;Hern andez-Brito et al., 2014;Peck et al., 2014). In this study, we present the most complete information on the distribution of ring-necked parakeets to date, comprising a set of about 1200 (686 native and 513 invasive) occurrences collected at a finer resolution than has previously been reported, 123 failed and successful introduction events across Europe, plus a high-resolution mtDNA molecular phylogeny derived from 98 museum specimens geospatially selected to cover the parakeet""s native range and from feather samples collected at 13 invaded sites across Europe. We expect that incorporating within-taxon niche structure into bioclimatic envelope models will result in important differences in the geographical distribution of climate predicted as suitable for parakeets across Europe and that accounting for association with human-modified habitats in the native range will allow for more accurate predictions of the potential European distribution of this ubiquitous avian invader."	0	"Here, using a unique dataset on the distribution of a global avian invader, the ring-necked parakeet (Psittacula krameri), we test whether accounting for within-taxon niche structure and association with humans in the native range leads to more accurate predictions of invasion risk.

CCT468	"Taken together, our results agree with other findings (Strubbe et al., 2013(#CITATION_TAG et al., , 2014Early & Sax, 2014;Guisan et al., 2014;Li et al., 2014), suggesting that while rapid post-introduction evolution (i.e. a change in the fundamental Grinnellian niche, Soberon, 2007) cannot be ruled out, climatic niche differences between native and invasive ranges are probably related to ecological factors governing the occupancy of the fundamental niche in native versus invaded ranges. This has important ramifications for the use of bioclimatic envelope models as risk assessment tools, as well as, more fundamentally, for understanding how climate and local factors interact to determine species"" distributions. Pearson & Dawson (2003) suggested a hierarchical approach to modelling environment-biota relationships whereby bioclimatic envelope models should form the first step, identifying the broad outlines of species"" distributions. Within the area designated as climatically suitable for a species, models including factors such as land cover and habitat preferences can then be applied to elucidate the finegrained structure of distributions. We suggest that, at least for invasive species, this framework may not be universally applicable, as association with human-modified habitats in the native range may allow species to overcome their (realized) native-range climatic limitations in human-modified landscapes elsewhere. Trait-based species risk assessments consider association with human-modified habitats in the native range to be a reliable predictor of invasion success (Keller et al., 2011), especially for mammals and birds (Jeschke & Strayer 2006). Our results show that applying a simple and universal variable such as the human footprint can considerably increase the accuracy of predictions of invasion risk, and this finding opens up real perspectives for devising and implementing more robust management strategies for a large number of invasive species. Information about the presence and geographical distribution of phylogeographic lineages may be not be readily available for all invasive species, but subspecies range maps can often be derived from the literature, at least for terrestrial vertebrates. Subspecies are generally based on discontinuities in the geographical distribution of phenotypic traits instead of molecular phylogenies, but can generally be considered useful proxies of patterns of divergence among populations (Phillimore & Owens, 2006). We therefore argue that, in order to provide to policymakers models that can accurately predict invasion risk, explicit evaluation of within-taxon niche structure and especially of association with humans in the native range is recommended."	1	"Taken together, our results agree with other findings (Strubbe et al., 2013(#CITATION_TAG et al., , 2014Early & Sax, 2014;Guisan et al., 2014;Li et al., 2014), suggesting that while rapid post-introduction evolution (i.e. a change in the fundamental Grinnellian niche, Soberon, 2007) cannot be ruled out, climatic niche differences between native and invasive ranges are probably related to ecological factors governing the occupancy of the fundamental niche in native versus invaded ranges.

We applied five different modelling algorithms: generalized linear models (GLM), generalized boosted models (GBM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), random forest (RF) and maximum entropy (MAXENT) to identify areas at risk of invasion. Models were fitted with default settings unless stated otherwise. Models were run with a single set of 10,000 pseudo-absences drawn from the same native-range background area as used for the niche analyses described above. Pseudo-absences were generated randomly from all grid cells in background area that were not presences (#CITATION_TAG & Guisan 2009). For each modelling algorithm, presences and pseudo-absences used to calibrate the model were weighted such as to ensure neutral (0.5) prevalence (Petitpierre et al., 2012). Each model was subjected to 10-fold cross-validation with a 80-20% random split of the presence data for training-testing each replicate, respectively. Models were evaluated using the true skill statistic (TSS), and to exclude inaccurate models, only those with TSS > 0.7 were kept for generating ensemble projections (Thuiller et al., 2013) of parakeet invasion risk in Europe, using unweighted averaging across models.

Ring-necked parakeets have almost 90% of their invasive distribution outside their native climatic niche (Fig. 1), and this is among the highest values of niche expansion known for vertebrates (Strubbe et al., 2013;Li et al., 2014). Previous studies suggest niche expansion into climates not occupied in the native range is more likely for species with small native ranges (plants, Early & Sax, 2014;amphibians and reptiles, Li et al., 2014), for species introduced longer ago or that have invaded areas located at lower latitudes than the native range (amphibians and reptiles, Early & Sax, 2014). Ring-necked parakeets, however, have a very large native range and have been introduced relatively recent (most European introductions stem from after 1970, Strubbe & Matthysen, 2009b) to much higher latitudes than their native range. Our results thus identify, for the first time, association with humans in the native range as a factor influencing climatic niche expansion during biological invasion.

In Europe, radio-tracking (Clergeau & Vergnes, 2011;Strubbe & Matthysen, 2011) and habitat selection studies (Strubbe & Matthysen, 2007;Newson et al., 2010) indicate that parakeets prefer to forage in city parks and gardens, where bird feeders and ornamental vegetation present parakeets with abundant food.

In the colder parts of Europe, parakeets increasingly breed in holes and crevices within the thermal insulation layers of buildings; in Germany, for example, such a more favourable microclimate enables them to achieve a higher breeding success compared to natural cavities (Braun, 2007). Moreover, in urban gardens, parakeets have been shown to be behaviourally dominant over native birds during foraging (Peck et al., 2014). Abundant resources and a lack of competitors may underlie the invasion success of ringnecked parakeets in environments far removed from their native (realized) niche.

Erroneous predictions of the potential distribution of invasive species are often attributed to species adaptations in response to selection pressures imposed by the novel environment (Whitney & Gabler, 2008). However, within the native range, species may also evolve pre-adaptations to invasiveness; strong selection imposed by human modification of habitats within the native range is likely to lead to adaptation prior to introduction elsewhere (Hufbauer et al., 2012). As human activities tend to promote similar ecological conditions across biogeographical areas (Savard et al., 2000), species or populations associated with human-modified habitats in the native range can be expected to successfully invade similar areas elsewhere.

Within the area designated as climatically suitable for a species, models including factors such as land cover and habitat preferences can then be applied to elucidate the finegrained structure of distributions. We suggest that, at least for invasive species, this framework may not be universally applicable, as association with human-modified habitats in the native range may allow species to overcome their (realized) native-range climatic limitations in human-modified landscapes elsewhere. Trait-based species risk assessments consider association with human-modified habitats in the native range to be a reliable predictor of invasion success (Keller et al., 2011), especially for mammals and birds (Jeschke & Strayer 2006). Our results show that applying a simple and universal variable such as the human footprint can considerably increase the accuracy of predictions of invasion risk, and this finding opens up real perspectives for devising and implementing more robust management strategies for a large number of invasive species. Information about the presence and geographical distribution of phylogeographic lineages may be not be readily available for all invasive species, but subspecies range maps can often be derived from the literature, at least for terrestrial vertebrates. Subspecies are generally based on discontinuities in the geographical distribution of phenotypic traits instead of molecular phylogenies, but can generally be considered useful proxies of patterns of divergence among populations (Phillimore & Owens, 2006). We therefore argue that, in order to provide to policymakers models that can accurately predict invasion risk, explicit evaluation of within-taxon niche structure and especially of association with humans in the native range is recommended."	0	"Taken together, our results agree with other findings (Strubbe et al., 2013(Strubbe et al., , 2014Early & Sax, 2014;#CITATION_TAG et al., 2014;Li et al., 2014), suggesting that while rapid post-introduction evolution (i.e. a change in the fundamental Grinnellian niche, Soberon, 2007) cannot be ruled out, climatic niche differences between native and invasive ranges are probably related to ecological factors governing the occupancy of the fundamental niche in native versus invaded ranges.

CCT480	Biological invasions are a major global environmental and economic problem (Sala et al., 2000). As eradication is frequently costly and sometimes impossible, attempting to limit the further introduction and spread of invasive species is the most effective and cost-efficient management strategy (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2002). To identify potentially invasive species, risk assessment protocols based on species traits associated with invasiveness have been developed (Keller et al., 2011). Spatially explicit predictions of invasion risk derived from bioclimatic envelope models [also referred to as species distribution models (SDM) or ecological niche models (ENM)] calibrated with native species distributions are increasingly incorporated into such invasive species risk assessments (Beaumont et al., 2014). To assess potential invasion risk, bioclimatic envelope models estimate the geographical distribution of climates suitable for invasive species (Ara ujo & Peterson, 2012). Applications of these models to invasive species, however, fail to consider how association with human-modified habitats in the native range, a species trait strongly associated with invasion success (Keller et al., 2011), might modify the distributional limits sets by climate. Also, models typically do not appreciate how the existence of phylogeographic lineages with differing niche requirements can influence forecasts of invasion risk (Pearman et al., 2010). Ignoring these factors may result in mismatches between predicted potential and realized invasive distributions, fuelling doubts about the suitability of bioclimatic envelope models for anticipating biological invasions (Guisan et al., 2014).	0	Biological invasions are a major global environmental and economic problem (Sala et al., 2000).

CCT481	"The fact that lineages associated with cold climates in the native range are more prevalent across Europe suggests that these lineages may be better adapted to European climates. Such an invasion scenario has been found before; for example, Rey et al. (2012) showed that the invasion of Mediterranean Israel by the tropical ant Wasmannia auropunctata could be explained by adaptation to cold at the southern limit of the native range before introduction to Israel. Yet, although large numbers of parakeets from both Africa and Asia have been imported to Europe (Morgan, 1993), more detailed knowledge on propagule pressure is required to rule out alternative explanations such as the possibility that more birds originating from colder parts of the native rang have escaped or been released across Europe. Also, it should be noted that our phylogeny is based on a set of neutral genetic markers and that consequently, patterns of within-taxon niche variation may be due to regional differences in available climates, to adaptation to local environments or to other drivers such as biotic interactions. However, populations are often adapted to local environments and genotypeby-environment interactions are common in widespread species (Pearman et al., 2010). This study is the first fine-scale assessment of ring-necked parakeet genetic structure, but differences among lineages in morphology and life history traits such as timing of reproduction have been reported within and between Africa and Asia (Forshaw, 1978). Such traits may be genetically based and therefore likely to respond to selection (#CITATION_TAG & Holzapfel, 2006) in the parakeet""s invasive range. Indeed, variance in laying dates between European and native (Asian) parakeet populations suggests that in Europe, parakeets are delaying their breeding in response to colder temperatures (Shwartz et al., 2009). These differences in morphology, life history and occupied climates suggest parakeet mtDNA-derived lineages may indeed diverge in features supplementary to the neutral genetic markers used to identify phylogeographic structure. Our results thus suggest the clade model captures lineage-specific responses to environmental gradients that are undetectable using the clade model (Appendix S8). Incorporating such within-taxon niche structure into bioclimatic envelope models only slightly increased model predictive accuracy, but nonetheless leads to important differences in spatial predictions of invasion risk for Europe (Figs 2 & 3). The climate-only clade model is strongly influenced by precipitation gradients (Appendix S8), resulting in erroneous predictions of parakeet occurrence for Europe""s wetter areas (i.e. parts of the Atlantic and Adriatic coast, and along mountain chains, Fig. 2a). The climate-only subclade model indicates certain phylogeographic lineages indeed respond strongly to precipitation gradients (Appendix S8), although in general, the subclade model is more strongly driven by temperature gradients. The climate-only subclade model accordingly correctly predicts some of the Mediterranean parakeet populations, and except for a high precipitation zone along the coast of Norway, it assigns a low invasion risk to coastal areas and mountain chains (Fig. 2b). Both climate-only models, however, fail to accurately forecast ringnecked parakeet occurrence across north-west Europe. When including the human footprint, the major difference between the clade and subclade model is that the latter places more weight on temperature and precipitation gradients (Appendix S8), whereas the clade model exhibits a higher dependency on human footprint. Consequently, the clade model predicts a higher invasion risk across human-dominated habitats in colder parts of continental Europe (Fig. 2c, d) as well. This becomes especially apparent when converting the predictions of invasion risk into discrete predictions of parakeet presence and absence (Fig. 3), showing that particularly in east and central Europe, the clade model predicts as suitable areas that are geographically peripheral to areas predicted as suitable by the subclade model. In contrast, in southern Europe, the subclade model predicts more extensive areas to be at risk of parakeet invasion, reflecting the different weightings given by the clade and subclade model to climate and human modification of habitats."	0	"Also, it should be noted that our phylogeny is based on a set of neutral genetic markers and that consequently, patterns of within-taxon niche variation may be due to regional differences in available climates, to adaptation to local environments or to other drivers such as biotic interactions. However, populations are often adapted to local environments and genotypeby-environment interactions are common in widespread species (Pearman et al., 2010). This study is the first fine-scale assessment of ring-necked parakeet genetic structure, but differences among lineages in morphology and life history traits such as timing of reproduction have been reported within and between Africa and Asia (Forshaw, 1978). Such traits may be genetically based and therefore likely to respond to selection (#CITATION_TAG & Holzapfel, 2006) in the parakeet""s invasive range. Indeed, variance in laying dates between European and native (Asian) parakeet populations suggests that in Europe, parakeets are delaying their breeding in response to colder temperatures (Shwartz et al., 2009). These differences in morphology, life history and occupied climates suggest parakeet mtDNA-derived lineages may indeed diverge in features supplementary to the neutral genetic markers used to identify phylogeographic structure. Our results thus suggest the clade model captures lineage-specific responses to environmental gradients that are undetectable using the clade model (Appendix S8)."	r

CCT484	"To assess niche differences between phylogroups and between native and invasive parakeet populations, we used the Broennimann et al. (2012) framework. This framework applies kernel smoothers to densities of species occurrence in a gridded environmental space to calculate metrics of niche overlap (quantified by Schoener""s D, 0: no overlap, 1: complete overlap). Using a randomization test whereby the measured niche overlap is compared against a null distribution of 100 simulated overlap values, we test whether parakeet niches are more similar to each other than expected by chance (i.e. niche similarity, Broennimann et al., 2012). We first assessed whether ring-necked parakeet climatic niches differed significantly between phylogroups (i.e. Africa versus Asian, and phylogroups within each continent), using all biomes occupied by parakeets across their native range as background area (Guisan et al., 2014). Second, native and invasive ring-necked parakeet occurrences were used to assess whether native niche characteristics are conserved during the invasion process (using a niche similarity test), and to determine whether parakeets have colonized in the invaded range climates not occupied in the native range (i.e. niche expansion, Petitpierre et al., 2012). Niche metrics are calculated on the climate space shared by native and invasive ranges (sensu Petitpierre et al., 2012). Background areas should reflect the set of areas a species could potentially have encountered since its presence in the region (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2011). Therefore, in Europe, we buffered each locality where parakeets have been introduced with a distance equal to the minimum invasion speed recorded for birds (i.e. 4.59 km year À1 , derived from Blackburn et al., 2009) multiplied by the number of years since introduction (see Strubbe et al., 2013 for details).

CCT485	"Following the procedures described above, we first fitted a ""clade"" model, using as presences all native-range grid cells occupied by parakeets (i.e. occurrences pooled across all phylogroups). Then, we built separate models for each phylogroup, using as presences all occupied grid cells located within phylogroup range boundaries. A composite ""subclade"" model was developed from the phylogroup predictions to summarize predictions of parakeet occurrence across all phylogroups. Because phylogroup models may differ in prevalence, to construct the subclade model, we first made the phylogroup models comparable by standardizing the average probabilities of occurrence for each phylogroup along the environmental gradients considered. Then, we calculated the mean probability of occurrence of at least one of the related phylogroups for grid cells using the multiplicative probability method described in Pearman et al. (2010). Clade and subclade models were fitted with and without human footprint, resulting in four different ensemble predictions of parakeet invasion risk in Europe. To exclude the possibility that differences in model performance are merely due to the adding of one predictor variable (human footprint) to the models, we also fitted models with a randomized version of the human footprint variable. To further assess the importance of human footprint, models described above were also run with the human footprint as sole predictor variable. Model transferability was assessed using European parakeet occurrence data (n = 513), applying the full range of evaluation statistics available in biomod2, plus two statistics specifically designed for presence-only models (the 10-fold and the continuous Boyce index, #CITATION_TAG et al., 2006). To convert the continuous clade and subclade ensemble predictions of invasion risk into discrete predictions of parakeet presence and absence across Europe, an optimal TSS threshold was calculated based on the European parakeet occurrences. Lastly, a climatic multivariate environmental similarity surface (MESS) map was calculated for Europe. This map indicates areas where climatic variables occur outside the range of values contained in model training regions, and predictions of invasion risk in these areas should be treated cautiously (Elith et al., 2010)."	5	Clade and subclade models were fitted with and without human footprint, resulting in four different ensemble predictions of parakeet invasion risk in Europe.

CCT486	"Therefore, we assess three key assumptions underlying bioclimatic envelope models: (1) that species"" distributions are largely governed by climate (Ara ujo & Peterson, 2012), (2) that a species"" current native distribution corresponds with the total set of climate conditions under which it can persist (Peterson, 2003) and (3) that the climatic niche remains conserved across time and space (Broennimann et al., 2007). Climate is generally recognized as a chief driver of species"" distributions at large spatial scales (Ara ujo & Peterson, 2012), although the broad distributional limits governed by climate may be modified by factors such as habitat availability, biotic interactions and dispersal limitations (Soberon, 2007). Erroneous predictions of the potential distribution of invasive species are often attributed to species adaptations in response to selection pressures imposed by the novel environment (Whitney & Gabler, 2008). However, within the native range, species may also evolve pre-adaptations to invasiveness; strong selection imposed by human modification of habitats within the native range is likely to lead to adaptation prior to introduction elsewhere (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2012). As human activities tend to promote similar ecological conditions across biogeographical areas (Savard et al., 2000), species or populations associated with human-modified habitats in the native range can be expected to successfully invade similar areas elsewhere.

CCT487	"Taken together, our results agree with other findings (Strubbe et al., 2013(Strubbe et al., , 2014Early & Sax, 2014;Guisan et al., 2014;Li et al., 2014), suggesting that while rapid post-introduction evolution (i.e. a change in the fundamental Grinnellian niche, Soberon, 2007) cannot be ruled out, climatic niche differences between native and invasive ranges are probably related to ecological factors governing the occupancy of the fundamental niche in native versus invaded ranges. This has important ramifications for the use of bioclimatic envelope models as risk assessment tools, as well as, more fundamentally, for understanding how climate and local factors interact to determine species"" distributions. Pearson & Dawson (2003) suggested a hierarchical approach to modelling environment-biota relationships whereby bioclimatic envelope models should form the first step, identifying the broad outlines of species"" distributions. Within the area designated as climatically suitable for a species, models including factors such as land cover and habitat preferences can then be applied to elucidate the finegrained structure of distributions. We suggest that, at least for invasive species, this framework may not be universally applicable, as association with human-modified habitats in the native range may allow species to overcome their (realized) native-range climatic limitations in human-modified landscapes elsewhere. Trait-based species risk assessments consider association with human-modified habitats in the native range to be a reliable predictor of invasion success (Keller et al., 2011), especially for mammals and birds (#CITATION_TAG & Strayer 2006).

CCT489	"Given its strong effect on the accuracy of predictions of invasion risk, incorporating information on association with human-modified habitats in the native range should be integrated into bioclimatic envelope models, if they are to effectively guide invasive species management. Association with human-modified habitats in the native range may enable ringnecked parakeets to exploit equivalent human-modified landscapes in Europe, allowing them to colonize areas far colder than their native range. Ring-necked parakeets have almost 90% of their invasive distribution outside their native climatic niche (Fig. 1), and this is among the highest values of niche expansion known for vertebrates (Strubbe et al., 2013;Li et al., 2014). Previous studies suggest niche expansion into climates not occupied in the native range is more likely for species with small native ranges (plants, Early & Sax, 2014;amphibians and reptiles, Li et al., 2014), for species introduced longer ago or that have invaded areas located at lower latitudes than the native range (amphibians and reptiles, Early & Sax, 2014). Ring-necked parakeets, however, have a very large native range and have been introduced relatively recent (most European introductions stem from after 1970, Strubbe & Matthysen, 2009b) to much higher latitudes than their native range. Our results thus identify, for the first time, association with humans in the native range as a factor influencing climatic niche expansion during biological invasion. Climate influences species distributions directly through species"" physiological tolerances or indirectly through its effect on available habitats, food resources and biotic interactions such as the presence of competitors (Ara ujo & Peterson, 2012, Wisz et al. 2013. The fact that ring-necked parakeets thrive in Europe suggests they may be physiologically capable of colonizing colder parts of the climate space in their native range as well. Possibly, a lack of resources and/or competition with congeneric species such as slaty-headed (P. himalayana) and Lord Derby""s Parakeet (P. derbiana) restricts the ring-necked parakeets"" native northernmost distribution limits. Indeed, endotherms such as birds are often able to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, but this comes at a potentially high energetic cost (Porter & Kearney, 2009). In Europe, radio-tracking (Clergeau & Vergnes, 2011;Strubbe & Matthysen, 2011) and habitat selection studies (Strubbe & Matthysen, 2007;Newson et al., 2010) indicate that parakeets prefer to forage in city parks and gardens, where bird feeders and ornamental vegetation present parakeets with abundant food. Urban areas also offer an Figure 3 Predictions of invasion risk for ring-necked parakeet in Europe derived from bioclimatic envelope models including association with human-modified habitats in the native range. Continuous model outputs (Fig. 2) were converted to binary predictions of invasion risk. Areas at risk according to both models without (see Fig. 2c) and with (see Fig. 2d) phylogeographic structure are indicated in red. Green indicates predicted parakeet presence only by a model without phylogeographic structure. Yellow delineates areas only marked as suitable by a model with phylogeographic structure. abundance of suitable nesting sites, as large, old trees are often retained for their aesthetic value. In the colder parts of Europe, parakeets increasingly breed in holes and crevices within the thermal insulation layers of buildings; in Germany, for example, such a more favourable microclimate enables them to achieve a higher breeding success compared to natural cavities (Braun, 2007). Moreover, in urban gardens, parakeets have been shown to be behaviourally dominant over native birds during foraging (Peck et al., 2014). Abundant resources and a lack of competitors may underlie the invasion success of ringnecked parakeets in environments far removed from their native (realized) niche. Yet, to elucidate the extent to which thermal and energetic constraints influence ring-necked parakeet distributional limits in their native versus non-native ranges, mechanistic niche models (which use species"" functional traits and physiological tolerances for model fitting, #CITATION_TAG et al., 2010) are required. Furthermore, although little is known about interactions between Psittacula species in their native range, the hypothesis of competitive release as an underlying driver of ring-necked parakeet invasion success in Europe may be tested by assessing whether predicted geographical distribution patterns across the native range (derived from bioclimatic models) match expectations under competitive exclusion (sensu Guti errez et al., 2014)."	0	"In the colder parts of Europe, parakeets increasingly breed in holes and crevices within the thermal insulation layers of buildings; in Germany, for example, such a more favourable microclimate enables them to achieve a higher breeding success compared to natural cavities (Braun, 2007).

CCT492	The vast majority of electromagnetic observatories are, by their very nature, directional. Thus, in order for gravitational wave observations to be useful to other astronomers, it is necessary to extract the sky location from the gravitational wave signal. However, gravitational 3 wave detectors are sensitive to signals from large fraction of the sky and a single gravitational wave detector provides essentially no directional information for a short duration source. Thus, the ability to reconstruct the location of a transient signal is primarily due to triangulation based on the observed time delays of the signal at several detectors. For more than two sites, requiring a consistency between the observed amplitudes will also serve to restrict the allowed sky positions. In particular, for three detectors, using only timing information, one obtains two sky locations that are mirror images with respect to the plane of the three detectors; generically the amplitude information can be used to break this degeneracy. The issue of localization of gravitational wave signals with a detector network has been discussed previously, and several different algorithms proposed [18]#CITATION_TAG[27].	2	Thus, the ability to reconstruct the location of a transient signal is primarily due to triangulation based on the observed time delays of the signal at several detectors.

CCT494	Based on the results of recent searches #CITATION_TAG, we will take an SNR of 7 in each of the LIGO and Virgo detectors to be the approximate amplitude where a binary coalescence signal would stand above the noise background. For BNS signals of this amplitude, table 1 gives a timing accuracy of 0.27 ms for the LIGO detectors and 0.19 ms for Virgo. This gives at best case localization of 20 deg 2 . A signal would require an SNR of around 25 and a well located source to reduce the 90% localization ellipse to 1 deg 2 -certainly a possibility for the louder sources in the advanced detector era. The localization accuracy for 10-10M BBH waveforms is comparable to BNS, namely 20 deg 2 for optimally located signals at single detector SNR of 7. Interestingly, the inclusion of the merger and ringdown portions of the signal provide an order of magnitude improvement in the localization accuracy. This improvement is consistent with what was observed in a detailed study of parameter estimation for BBH [43].	4	Based on the results of recent searches #CITATION_TAG, we will take an SNR of 7 in each of the LIGO and Virgo detectors to be the approximate amplitude where a binary coalescence signal would stand above the noise background.

CCT520	"As detailed above, basic changes in respiration can have a significant impact on HRV. Pneumotachography is the gold standard for the monitoring of tidal volume, however, the use of a closed face-mask required to do so is cumbersome and impractical for most research in emotion and psychological science (e.g., faceto-face interactions). In lieu of this, the use of a strain gage to index the expansion of the chest can give sufficient informationmost importantly, a strain gage can identify gross deviations of typical cyclical respiration (e.g., sighs, coughs).

CCT521	Coupling between respiration and heart rate (HR) has a long research history, and was noted in classical animal studies predating the electrocardiogram, which noticed fluctuations with breathing of heart beat and blood pressure (Ludwig, 1847). Consequently, the typically functioning respiratory system is presently characterized by complex breath-to-breath variations in respiratory rate and depth (Bruce, 1996) coupled with both heart period and blood pressure oscillations in a network of continual co-modification. For instance, a decrease in respiratory frequency generally corresponds with a lengthening of the heart period (Bruce, 1996). The traditional experimental approach of assessing the impact of the manipulation of one of these variables on another has led to important advancements in the understanding of cardiorespiratory coupling. However, perturbing the cardiorespiratory system does not allow the observation of casual relationships during spontaneous activity. Procedures developed to examine the coupling between time series may facilitate the identification of directionality and strength of cardiorespiratory coupling during spontaneous activity but these traditionally have only provided a limited insight into causality (e.g., Granger causality;Granger, 1969). Indeed, cardiorespiratory interaction has been variously quantified as primarily respiration-to-heart rate (Rosenblum et al., 2002;Zhu et al., 2013) heart rate-to-respiration (Larsen et al., 1999;#CITATION_TAG et al., 2003) or neither (i.e., bidirectional; Porta et al., 2013). These differences are likely to strongly depend on the analytical technique employed, but the details of this are unclear.	0	The traditional experimental approach of assessing the impact of the manipulation of one of these variables on another has led to important advancements in the understanding of cardiorespiratory coupling.

CCT522	"A number of external factors are usually controlled for in HRV research, including the intake of nicotine (Hayano et al., 1990;Sjoberg and Saint, 2011) and caffeine (Sondermeijer et al., 2002) preceding data collection. Cardioactive medication use, including some antidepressant classes (e.g., tricyclics; Kemp et al., 2010), some antipsychotic classes (e.g., clozapine; Cohen et al., 2001), benzodiazepines (Agelink et al., 2002), and antihypertensives (Schroeder et al., 2003) are also usually accounted for, although this may be somewhat difficult in practice when testing patient populations. Other factors that are usually accounted for include the time of day (Massin et al., 2000;van Eekelen et al., 2004), levels of habitual alcohol use (Quintana et al., 2013a,b), Woo et al. (1992). physical activity levels (Britton et al., 2007;Soares-Miranda et al., 2014), and age (O""Brien et al., 1986). Digestion of food and water are less commonly accounted for in HRV research, but both provoke a coordinated autonomic response. For instance, digesting food has been shown to reduce parasympathetic activity, even an hour after eating a 500 kcal meal (Lu et al., 1999). Even exposure to food-related cues elicits a similar response (Nederkoorn et al., 2000), suggesting a physiological response to the anticipation of a meal. Conversely, missing a meal (i.e., fasting) appears to have its own coordinated effects on HRV (Pivik et al., 2006), supporting the recommendation that participants consume a light meal approximately 2 h before the assessment of HRV (Tak et al., 2009). Water consumption has also been shown to increase HF-HRV in particular (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2002), due to the vagal buffering response to the pressor effect provoked by hypo-osmotic fluids (Scott et al., 2001). Notably, this buffering response to the pressor effect is attenuated in older individuals (Jordan et al., 2000) and not observed in those with cardiac vagal denervation (Routledge et al., 2002). In addition, both bladder and gastric distension can also have an appreciable influence on HRV; these have been associated with increases in blood pressure and sympathetic outflow (Fagius and Karhuvaara, 1989;Rossi et al., 1998). However, papers only very rarely report that participants were asked to empty their bladder before experimental participation (Heathers, 2014)."	0	For instance, digesting food has been shown to reduce parasympathetic activity, even an hour after eating a 500 kcal meal (Lu et al., 1999).

CCT523	(1) Heart rate variability is affected by respiratory depth (Hirsch and Bishop, 1981) and frequency (Angelone and Coulter, 1964;Brown et al., 1993). Specifically, greater RSA magnitude occurs during higher tidal volumes and lower respiratory frequencies. In addition, basal respiratory frequency has a non-linear relationship with spectral power as breathing rate falls below approximately 0.15 Hz (as it occasionally does in athletes; #CITATION_TAG et al., 2014). Thus, any task that increases respiratory tidal volume and/or reduces respiratory frequency (e.g., meditation; Krygier et al., 2013), or conversely decreases tidal volume and/or increases respiratory frequency (e.g., mental stress; Houtveen et al., 2002) is likely to indirectly modify HRV. More recently, it has also been shown that the inspiration:expiration (I:E) ratio also effects HRV (Strauss-Blasche et al., 2000). Specifically, HRV increases when short inspiration is followed by long expiration -which has implications for tasks that require speech production (Cysarz et al., 2004) and many forms of meditation, for instance. Even monitoring spontaneous breathing has been found to reduce respiratory variability (Cysarz and Büssing, 2005;Conrad et al., 2007). HR driven cardiorespiratory coupling also appears to increase when HRV is higher (Galletly and Larsen, 2001).	0	(1) Heart rate variability is affected by respiratory depth (Hirsch and Bishop, 1981) and frequency (Angelone and Coulter, 1964;Brown et al., 1993).

CCT525	While it may be the case that HRV can be used as a neurobiological index of interpersonal interaction, significant caveats exist due to the complicated nature of HRV and consequently uncertainty regarding what information is actually provided by common HRV indices (Berntson et al., 1997;Malpas, 2002;Billman, 2011). Additionally, the relationship between HRV and vagal modulation is complex in itself with a large interindividual variation (Picard et al., 2009). The problem is further compounded by the co-modulation of various respiratory and circulatory factors, which occur via numerous mechanisms and over multiple time-scales. Moreover, both breathing and blood pressure regulation have their own directly mediated relationships to the tasks employed in social, emotional, and cognitive experiments -if this is the case, we often have a complicated question of interlocking causalities. For instance, are observed changes in heart period epiphenomena that can be more parsimoniously described by changes in breathing or blood pressure? If the direction of causality between experimental task and the coordinated response within cardiac, circulatory, and respiratory variables is poorly understood, simple relationships between task and output changes may be obscured. Finally, experiments are often poorly designed as uncontrolled variables within typical experimental environments may drastically influence HRV. Few papers ideally control for medication, food, and water consumption, bladder filling, time of day, and other extraneous factors (Tak et al., 2009;#CITATION_TAG, 2014). The overall aim of this review is to highlight the interrelationships between the nature and extraneous control of HRV, with a particular emphasis on respiration, and discuss implications for research in emotion science and psychology. Firstly, a number of important factors for the assessment of HRV in general and in emotion psychology in particular will be outlined. Secondly, solutions will be presented to reduce the potential impact of these factors.	0	For instance, are observed changes in heart period epiphenomena that can be more parsimoniously described by changes in breathing or blood pressure?

CCT526	Frequency analysis assumes the HR signal is stationary (Stratonovich, 1967) and that over time it can be modeled as the sum of cyclical processes, but this is demonstrably not the case. While removing slow or DC trends from short periods of HRV will create a quasi-stationary series (e.g., Tarvainen et al., 2002), HRV in general displays the characteristics of a non-linear signal, given the biological origin and the origin of HRV deriving from sum of processes that operate on a variety of time scales (Winfree, 2001;#CITATION_TAG and Guzik, 2007;Stein et al., 2008). The non-linear interaction of the PNS and SNS systems may also contribute to heart beat complexity observed in healthy participants (Levy, 1971). 1/f-like scaling of the heart beat signal, which is characteristic of a heart beat series from a healthy individual (Ivanov et al., 1999;Goldberger et al., 2002), also points to a nonlinear basis. A 1/f scaling of the heart beat signal (α = 1) falls exactly between a completely random signal (α = 0.5; i.e., white noise) and an entirely predictable signal (α = 1.5). For instance, pathological heart rhythms tend to demonstrate Brownian noise (Peng et al., 1995). A complex interaction of linear and non-linear systems contribute to HRV (Voss et al., 2009), which suggests that measures of complexity may be a better measure of autonomic nervous system outflow (Kaplan et al., 1991). Indeed, non-linear measures of HRV have demonstrated improved prognostic information in heart failure patients with in comparison to linear HRV measures (Bigger et al., 1996;Huikuri et al., 2000). However, the utility of non-linear HRV measures have been questioned due to a lack of reproducibility (Tan et al., 2009). Intriguingly, non-linear analysis indicates that some elderly patients with cardiovascular disease unexpectedly display increased HRV indices (Stein et al., 2005) due to erratic, nonrespiratory sinus arrhythmia. These erratic rhythms have also been found to predict the onset of ventricular tachycardia (Mäkikallio et al., 1997) and mortality post-myocardial infarction (Stein et al., 2008). The source of this erratic non-respiratory sinus arrhythmia may be due to increased sympathetic activity (Tulppo et al., 1998), which is consistent with the higher concentrations of plasma noradrenaline observed in patients post-myocardial infarction (Christensen and Videbaek, 1974). Alternatively, erratic rhythms may be caused by poor coordination between the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, which could reflect a pre-clinical manifestation of sick sinus syndrome (Stein et al., 2008).	0	Frequency analysis assumes the HR signal is stationary (Stratonovich, 1967) and that over time it can be modeled as the sum of cyclical processes, but this is demonstrably not the case.

CCT527	"A Poincaré plot is a visual, non-linear HRV index comprised of points that represent two consecutive heart periods, with any point above the identity line (a 45 • slope that passes through the origin, which represents equal consecutive heart periods) representing a longer heart period, whereas points below the identity line represent a shortening of the heart period. A healthy participant typically displays a ""comet"" shaped plot (Figure 1A), with a wider dispersion of points as the beats lengthen. Even at different rates of breathing (ranging from 6 to 16 breaths/min) this shape persists in healthy participants (Guzik et al., 2007). On the other hand, patients with heart failure display atypical ""torpedo,"" ""fan,"" or ""complex"" (i.e., stepwise clusters of points) patterns (Woo et al., 1992). A torpedo shape (Figure 1B) is indicative of a lack of R-R interval increase when HR slows, whereas fan and complex patterns (Figure 1C) may represent general issues with cardiac autonomic regulation. Poincaré plots have been demonstrated to shown to display significant asymmetry in approximately 80% of individuals (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2006;Piskorski and Guzik, 2007;Porta et al., 2008), with the plot ""cloud"" above the identity line appearing larger than the plot cloud below the line. Absent of longterm trends or very low frequency (VLF) power changes typically removed via detrending or high-pass filtering, HR acceleration will be matched with a roughly corresponding deceleration over time, and the Poincaré plots might be expected to be symmetrical. However, this commonly observed asymmetry in Poincaré plots suggests that HR accelerations operate in a different manner than decelerations, possibly due to baroreflex responses (Guzik et al., 2006). While the source of this asymmetry is unclear, it reinforces the fact that HRV is generated by complex non-linear dynamics. Together, this work emphasizes the importance of scrutinizing Poincaré plots for irregularities, particularly for populations characterized by low HRV (e.g., older participants), and urges caution with the central assumption that IBIs over time can be meaningfully devolved into the sum of sine waves as in traditional frequency-domain analysis."	0	"Even at different rates of breathing (ranging from 6 to 16 breaths/min) this shape persists in healthy participants (Guzik et al., 2007).

CCT531	While it may be the case that HRV can be used as a neurobiological index of interpersonal interaction, significant caveats exist due to the complicated nature of HRV and consequently uncertainty regarding what information is actually provided by common HRV indices (Berntson et al., 1997;Malpas, 2002;#CITATION_TAG, 2011). Additionally, the relationship between HRV and vagal modulation is complex in itself with a large interindividual variation (Picard et al., 2009). The problem is further compounded by the co-modulation of various respiratory and circulatory factors, which occur via numerous mechanisms and over multiple time-scales. Moreover, both breathing and blood pressure regulation have their own directly mediated relationships to the tasks employed in social, emotional, and cognitive experiments -if this is the case, we often have a complicated question of interlocking causalities. For instance, are observed changes in heart period epiphenomena that can be more parsimoniously described by changes in breathing or blood pressure? If the direction of causality between experimental task and the coordinated response within cardiac, circulatory, and respiratory variables is poorly understood, simple relationships between task and output changes may be obscured. Finally, experiments are often poorly designed as uncontrolled variables within typical experimental environments may drastically influence HRV. Few papers ideally control for medication, food, and water consumption, bladder filling, time of day, and other extraneous factors (Tak et al., 2009;Heathers, 2014). The overall aim of this review is to highlight the interrelationships between the nature and extraneous control of HRV, with a particular emphasis on respiration, and discuss implications for research in emotion science and psychology. Firstly, a number of important factors for the assessment of HRV in general and in emotion psychology in particular will be outlined. Secondly, solutions will be presented to reduce the potential impact of these factors.	0	While it may be the case that HRV can be used as a neurobiological index of interpersonal interaction, significant caveats exist due to the complicated nature of HRV and consequently uncertainty regarding what information is actually provided by common HRV indices (Berntson et al., 1997;Malpas, 2002;#CITATION_TAG, 2011).

CCT532	In light of the complex interactions described above, a withinsubjects design is the most appropriate method to explore the role of cardiorespiratory oscillations on behavior. Indeed, to appropriately detect a difference between groups, a sample size between 30 and 77, depending on the HRV metric used, is needed (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2007). However, subgroups are commonly employed in these designs (e.g., gender, psychiatric comorbidities), which have been suggested to require 20 participants per cell (Simmons et al., 2011). Although some contexts make this difficult (i.e., comparison of psychiatric groups), within-subjects is the ideal design. The use of within-subjects design can eliminate any interindividual differences in coupling between HR, BP, and respiration. For instance, approximately 30% of individuals do not demonstrate any discernable synchrony between respiration and HR (Schäfer et al., 1998;Tzeng et al., 2003), with cardiorespiratory synchronization less likely to occur during higher breathing frequencies. While it is debatable if respiration should be controlled in HRV recordings, it is clear that sighs and long breaths have an effect on HRV as they generate non-sinus rhythm HR.	0	In light of the complex interactions described above, a withinsubjects design is the most appropriate method to explore the role of cardiorespiratory oscillations on behavior.

CCT535	Coupling between respiration and heart rate (HR) has a long research history, and was noted in classical animal studies predating the electrocardiogram, which noticed fluctuations with breathing of heart beat and blood pressure (Ludwig, 1847). Consequently, the typically functioning respiratory system is presently characterized by complex breath-to-breath variations in respiratory rate and depth (Bruce, 1996) coupled with both heart period and blood pressure oscillations in a network of continual co-modification. For instance, a decrease in respiratory frequency generally corresponds with a lengthening of the heart period (Bruce, 1996). The traditional experimental approach of assessing the impact of the manipulation of one of these variables on another has led to important advancements in the understanding of cardiorespiratory coupling. However, perturbing the cardiorespiratory system does not allow the observation of casual relationships during spontaneous activity. Procedures developed to examine the coupling between time series may facilitate the identification of directionality and strength of cardiorespiratory coupling during spontaneous activity but these traditionally have only provided a limited insight into causality (e.g., Granger causality;Granger, 1969). Indeed, cardiorespiratory interaction has been variously quantified as primarily respiration-to-heart rate (Rosenblum et al., 2002;Zhu et al., 2013) heart rate-to-respiration (#CITATION_TAG et al., 1999;Tzeng et al., 2003) or neither (i.e., bidirectional; Porta et al., 2013). These differences are likely to strongly depend on the analytical technique employed, but the details of this are unclear.	0	The traditional experimental approach of assessing the impact of the manipulation of one of these variables on another has led to important advancements in the understanding of cardiorespiratory coupling.

CCT536	The nature of cardiorespiratory coupling is of intense research interest, highlighted most centrally by a robust debate concerning the central (Eckberg, 2009) and baroreflex (Karemaker, 2009) mechanism contributions to respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). There is also a common genetic influence on HRV and respiration (Kupper et al., 2005). To further complicate this already complex relationship, the degree of cardiorespiratory coupling depends on the respiratory rate. That is, as the respiratory rate increases, HR increases phase distance from respiration. For instance, a breathing rate of 5-6 breaths per minute corresponds with a phase angle increase of 90 • , continuing to a phase angle of 180 • with 10 breaths per minute (#CITATION_TAG and Coulter, 1964). Indeed, a presumed tenet of RSA -that shorter R-R intervals should be coupled with the apogee of inspiration -only occurs at a slow respiratory rate of six breaths per minute (Vaschillo et al., 2004), around half the natural respiration rate. However, there is no relationship between cardiorespiratory coupling and baroreflex sensitivity or blood pressure variability (Tzeng et al., 2003).	0	There is also a common genetic influence on HRV and respiration (Kupper et al., 2005).

CCT537	Further, shared neural networks for respiratory and HR oscillations (Evans et al., 2009) suggest that the manipulation on breathing may also lead to unintended effects on HRV by removing some of the variance in HRV that may relevantly covary with experimental task. Intriguingly, the degree of coupling may be higher when HRV is increased and at lower breathing frequencies (#CITATION_TAG and Larsen, 2001;Tzeng et al., 2003), suggesting that unhealthy populations or experiments that are designed to reduce HRV may be more prone to decoupling of cardiorespiratory oscillations. This observation is particularly relevant when comparing two populations that may display different breathing frequencies (e.g., anxious vs. non-anxious participants) or when an experimental manipulation modifies respiration. Notably, respiration is not a necessary condition to modify HR over time as variability is still observed (although significantly reduced) without mechanical respiratory input to the heart (Larsen et al., 1999). Conversely, individuals with no vagal input to the heart (e.g., heart transplant recipients) still demonstrate RSA (although to a much smaller degree) presumably due to mechanical effects on the sinoatrial node (Bernardi et al., 1989;Slovut et al., 1998). While respiration influences blood pressure via mechanical intrathoracic pressure changes, this is buffered by HRV (Toska and Eriksen, 1993;Elstad et al., 2001). The influence of respiration on blood pressure is likely to be caused by the mechanical influence on venous return, modulating cardiac output (Triedman and Saul, 1994) via changes in stroke volume, which in turn influences blood pressure (Elstad et al., 2001).	0	Further, shared neural networks for respiratory and HR oscillations (Evans et al., 2009) suggest that the manipulation on breathing may also lead to unintended effects on HRV by removing some of the variance in HRV that may relevantly covary with experimental task.

Consequently, emotional interventions that reduce PNS activation could inflate reductions in HRV via HR increases that are independent of changes in cardiac autonomic nerve activity.

CCT542	"A Poincaré plot is a visual, non-linear HRV index comprised of points that represent two consecutive heart periods, with any point above the identity line (a 45 • slope that passes through the origin, which represents equal consecutive heart periods) representing a longer heart period, whereas points below the identity line represent a shortening of the heart period. A healthy participant typically displays a ""comet"" shaped plot (Figure 1A), with a wider dispersion of points as the beats lengthen. Even at different rates of breathing (ranging from 6 to 16 breaths/min) this shape persists in healthy participants (Guzik et al., 2007). On the other hand, patients with heart failure display atypical ""torpedo,"" ""fan,"" or ""complex"" (i.e., stepwise clusters of points) patterns (Woo et al., 1992). A torpedo shape (Figure 1B) is indicative of a lack of R-R interval increase when HR slows, whereas fan and complex patterns (Figure 1C) may represent general issues with cardiac autonomic regulation. Poincaré plots have been demonstrated to shown to display significant asymmetry in approximately 80% of individuals (Guzik et al., 2006;Piskorski and Guzik, 2007;#CITATION_TAG et al., 2008), with the plot ""cloud"" above the identity line appearing larger than the plot cloud below the line. Absent of longterm trends or very low frequency (VLF) power changes typically removed via detrending or high-pass filtering, HR acceleration will be matched with a roughly corresponding deceleration over time, and the Poincaré plots might be expected to be symmetrical. However, this commonly observed asymmetry in Poincaré plots suggests that HR accelerations operate in a different manner than decelerations, possibly due to baroreflex responses (Guzik et al., 2006). While the source of this asymmetry is unclear, it reinforces the fact that HRV is generated by complex non-linear dynamics. Together, this work emphasizes the importance of scrutinizing Poincaré plots for irregularities, particularly for populations characterized by low HRV (e.g., older participants), and urges caution with the central assumption that IBIs over time can be meaningfully devolved into the sum of sine waves as in traditional frequency-domain analysis."	0	"Even at different rates of breathing (ranging from 6 to 16 breaths/min) this shape persists in healthy participants (Guzik et al., 2007).

CCT543	Coupling between respiration and heart rate (HR) has a long research history, and was noted in classical animal studies predating the electrocardiogram, which noticed fluctuations with breathing of heart beat and blood pressure (Ludwig, 1847). Consequently, the typically functioning respiratory system is presently characterized by complex breath-to-breath variations in respiratory rate and depth (Bruce, 1996) coupled with both heart period and blood pressure oscillations in a network of continual co-modification. For instance, a decrease in respiratory frequency generally corresponds with a lengthening of the heart period (Bruce, 1996). The traditional experimental approach of assessing the impact of the manipulation of one of these variables on another has led to important advancements in the understanding of cardiorespiratory coupling. However, perturbing the cardiorespiratory system does not allow the observation of casual relationships during spontaneous activity. Procedures developed to examine the coupling between time series may facilitate the identification of directionality and strength of cardiorespiratory coupling during spontaneous activity but these traditionally have only provided a limited insight into causality (e.g., Granger causality;Granger, 1969). Indeed, cardiorespiratory interaction has been variously quantified as primarily respiration-to-heart rate (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2002;Zhu et al., 2013) heart rate-to-respiration (Larsen et al., 1999;Tzeng et al., 2003) or neither (i.e., bidirectional; Porta et al., 2013). These differences are likely to strongly depend on the analytical technique employed, but the details of this are unclear.	0	The traditional experimental approach of assessing the impact of the manipulation of one of these variables on another has led to important advancements in the understanding of cardiorespiratory coupling.

CCT544	"Social-emotional tasks have been shown to reduce breathing variability (Vlemincx et al., 2011(Vlemincx et al., , 2012a, even for positively valenced emotions (Boiten, 1998), due to the ""locked-in"" attention often required during social-emotional tasks. Moreover, the mental stress that usually accompanies these tasks can also disorder general respiratory coordination (Vlemincx et al., 2012b). In addition to overall breathing variability, experimental stress induction can also influence the specific length of inspiration and expiration (Cohen et al., 1975). Thus, a social-emotional task that induces a change in respiratory time variables and/or depth may be indirectly influencing HRV. The rates of sighing also increase during these tasks (Vlemincx et al., 2011), with sighs shown to ""reset"" both respiratory variability and emotional states (Vlemincx et al., 2013). This is consistent with observations of increased sighing in a range of anxiety disorders (Abelson et al., 2001;Nardi et al., 2009), and increased sighing during experimentally induced stress (Vlemincx et al., 2012b). Finally, continual focused attention (e.g., during psychometrics tasks) has been shown in a number of studies (Mulder and Mulder, 1981;#CITATION_TAG et al., 1987;Middleton et al., 1999) to reduce LF HRV, which creates further difficulties for interpretation."	0	"Thus, a social-emotional task that induces a change in respiratory time variables and/or depth may be indirectly influencing HRV.

CCT545	"Several caveats exist to the establishment of a baseline as an appropriate point of comparison. Firstly, the baseline HR needs to be able to support the respiratory signal without aliasing (Witte et al., 1988) -for instance, a normative breathing rate of 0.3 Hz can only be observed successfully in a HR faster than 0.6 Hz (i.e., 36 bpm). In a regular ECG, this criterion is often met. However, during supine recording, transient beats and intervals in healthy young people are frequently below 0.8 Hz (i.e., 48 bpm) -this may extend up to the entire IBI series in the case of physically fit individuals or any other participant displaying bradycardia. This corresponds with the fastest criterion for RSA in the HF-HRV band (i.e., 0.4 Hz). While this is an abnormal situation (see Sacha and Grzeszczak, 2002), it is a potential confound to the establishment of a baseline, especially if IBI series are filtered incorrectly (Grossman and Taylor, 2007). Secondly, physically fit participants may not have sinus rhythm appropriate for analysis in the first instance due to potential changes to the sinoatrial node -hearts of such individuals have often been assumed to be slower at rest due to higher vagal tone but the balance of evidence does not presently favor this explanation (Boyett et al., 2013). However, the resumption of ""normal"" sinus rhythm may be observed during exercise, orthostatic stress, etc. -if this is an experimental condition, then the transition from resting baseline is affected. Thirdly, tasks often compare passive eyes-open rest as a baseline to the performance of a psychomotor, attentional, or emotional task, for instance. It is possible that this conflates the difference between passive rest vs. the act of paying attention to task with the difference between passive rest vs. the specific task demands of the experiment in question. A popular alternative to complete rest is the Vanilla baseline (Jennings et al., 1992), which requires subjects to perform a trivial counting task requiring sustained attention but minimal cognitive load, as opposed to what the authors term ""enforced relaxation."" Other similar approaches have been attempted (e.g., #CITATION_TAG et al., 2000). Other similar approaches have been attempted (e.g., Piferi et al., 2000). Finally, with individual recordings made over time, there is the complicated situation of the immediacy of baseline-toexperiment transition. HR is not stable over time, and can exhibit non-periodic phenomena or bifurcations, which may be in conflict with the assumption that an initial baseline well reflects a later experimental condition. Researchers must also consider the potential effect of decay between tasks if cardiorespiratory effects are observed, what a normalization to baseline might look like, and of course the fact that secondary baselines may conflict with experimental instructions or manipulations. It is inherent from the above that an appropriate baseline is not a singular measurement with""correct""parameters under all circumstances, but rather the non-task situation that best controls for the presence of task comparison. In many situations, the comparison of a task to a ""resting"" state will therefore vary in appropriateness."	0	"Thirdly, tasks often compare passive eyes-open rest as a baseline to the performance of a psychomotor, attentional, or emotional task, for instance.

CCT546	While it may be the case that HRV can be used as a neurobiological index of interpersonal interaction, significant caveats exist due to the complicated nature of HRV and consequently uncertainty regarding what information is actually provided by common HRV indices (Berntson et al., 1997;Malpas, 2002;Billman, 2011). Additionally, the relationship between HRV and vagal modulation is complex in itself with a large interindividual variation (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2009). The problem is further compounded by the co-modulation of various respiratory and circulatory factors, which occur via numerous mechanisms and over multiple time-scales. Moreover, both breathing and blood pressure regulation have their own directly mediated relationships to the tasks employed in social, emotional, and cognitive experiments -if this is the case, we often have a complicated question of interlocking causalities. For instance, are observed changes in heart period epiphenomena that can be more parsimoniously described by changes in breathing or blood pressure? If the direction of causality between experimental task and the coordinated response within cardiac, circulatory, and respiratory variables is poorly understood, simple relationships between task and output changes may be obscured. Finally, experiments are often poorly designed as uncontrolled variables within typical experimental environments may drastically influence HRV. Few papers ideally control for medication, food, and water consumption, bladder filling, time of day, and other extraneous factors (Tak et al., 2009;Heathers, 2014). The overall aim of this review is to highlight the interrelationships between the nature and extraneous control of HRV, with a particular emphasis on respiration, and discuss implications for research in emotion science and psychology. Firstly, a number of important factors for the assessment of HRV in general and in emotion psychology in particular will be outlined. Secondly, solutions will be presented to reduce the potential impact of these factors.	0	While it may be the case that HRV can be used as a neurobiological index of interpersonal interaction, significant caveats exist due to the complicated nature of HRV and consequently uncertainty regarding what information is actually provided by common HRV indices (Berntson et al., 1997;Malpas, 2002;Billman, 2011).

Cardioactive medication use, including some antidepressant classes (e.g., tricyclics; Kemp et al., 2010), some antipsychotic classes (e.g., clozapine; Cohen et al., 2001), benzodiazepines (Agelink et al., 2002), and antihypertensives (Schroeder et al., 2003) are also usually accounted for, although this may be somewhat difficult in practice when testing patient populations.

Even exposure to food-related cues elicits a similar response (Nederkoorn et al., 2000), suggesting a physiological response to the anticipation of a meal. Conversely, missing a meal (i.e., fasting) appears to have its own coordinated effects on HRV (Pivik et al., 2006), supporting the recommendation that participants consume a light meal approximately 2 h before the assessment of HRV (Tak et al., 2009). Water consumption has also been shown to increase HF-HRV in particular (Routledge et al., 2002), due to the vagal buffering response to the pressor effect provoked by hypo-osmotic fluids (Scott et al., 2001). Notably, this buffering response to the pressor effect is attenuated in older individuals (Jordan et al., 2000) and not observed in those with cardiac vagal denervation (Routledge et al., 2002). In addition, both bladder and gastric distension can also have an appreciable influence on HRV; these have been associated with increases in blood pressure and sympathetic outflow (Fagius and Karhuvaara, 1989;#CITATION_TAG et al., 1998).

Recently, temperature was also shown to affect the concentration of ribosomes in phytoplankton; at a constant protein synthesis, relatively more ribosomes are needed at low temperature #CITATION_TAG. This is in line with the temperature effect that we observed, and the most plausible reason for the reduced C:P and N:P at low temperature and light.	4	pone. 0126308. g006 variability with increasing growth rate in phytoplankton, suggesting that fast-growing phytoplankton in general require more P, and also have a more confined N:P ratio compared with slow-growing phytoplankton.

CCT554	Light and temperature have several well-known effects on primary production #CITATION_TAG. Under natural conditions with fluctuating light intensity there will be a continuous acclimation of light absorption and photosynthetic activity through the production of photosynthetic pigments and regulation of the energy channeled to the photochemical reaction centers. The light reactions are not directly dependent on temperature, but temperature affects enzymatic processes, membrane fluidity and intermolecular collision processes [42]. Light acclimation will affect photosynthesis under both limiting and saturating light conditions, whereas temperature will mostly affect photosynthesis at saturating light conditions [42]. As such, photosynthetic production will be optimized under all but the most limiting environmental conditions. The present experiments support these basic paradigms also for the cold-water diatom, despite (or more accurately: by means of) the observed variability in stoichiometry.	0	Light and temperature have several well-known effects on primary production #CITATION_TAG.

CCT556	The interplay between environmental factors such as light, temperature and nutrient availability and the physiology of the cell determines the growth rate and stoichiometric composition of the major elements in algae. Traditionally factors such as the growth-limiting nutrient have been used to model nutrient uptake and growth [27], and recent advances have started to incorporate uptake-protein regulation into this equation [28][29]. The latter is an important step  as it incorporates the nutrient history of the primary producers, which is decisive in regulating the uptake rate determined by e.g. the number of uptake sites. The present data support the growing understanding of the interaction between fundamental abiotic parameters that should be included in growth models. Geider and La Roche #CITATION_TAG pointed out in their review on algal stoichiometry that relatively few studies examine the phenotypic flexibility in C:N:P during exponential growth and that more studies are needed in order to better understand the effect of temperature and light on these ratios. Under nutrient replete conditions the variability in the C:N:P ratio is normally larger between different species than between different environmental conditions such as variation in temperature [30]. Our data support this to some extent, as there was low variability in the C:N during active growth. However, C:P and N:P was twofold different between the lowest and highest value. The larger variability in C:P and N:P was caused by high P content relative to C and N at low light and temperature acclimation. Strong latitudinal patterns in the C:N:P ratio was recently described, and a lower than average ratio was associated with high latitudes [31]. Martiny et al. [31] suggested this lower C:N:P ratio to be caused by the largely diatom dominated communities present in cold water, but diatoms have also been associated with higher C:N:P ratio [32].

CCT560	We may expect climate change to disproportionally affect regions with strong seasonality in light availability and surface water temperature. Thus, it is important to improve biogeochemical models particularly in regions where seasonal primary production is coupled to low temperatures, such as seas and oceans at high latitudes. Most of the focus on interaction effects between different environmental variables stems from work on lakes [15]#CITATION_TAG. Coastal areas in arctic or subarctic regions will be subjected to many of the same changes, but relatively few studies have addressed interaction effects in these areas, in particular for cold water adapted phytoplankton species [16][17].	0	We may expect climate change to disproportionally affect regions with strong seasonality in light availability and surface water temperature.

CCT561	The photosynethic quotient (PQ) is given as the molar ratio of oxygen (in the form of O ) produced per C fixed by photosynthesis. The PQ is normally >1, indicating that a fraction of the reducing power created in the light reaction is used for other purposes than C fixation in the Calvin-Benson cycle, e.g. lipid or protein synthesis [12]. Furthermore, when the N source is nitrate that needs to be reduced, the PQ will be higher compared to a situation where ammonium is the N source [13]. Another process that will affect the PQ is photorespiration, which is a process consuming the O 2 produced during photosynthesis and thereby lowering the PQ #CITATION_TAG.	0	The photosynethic quotient (PQ) is given as the molar ratio of oxygen (in the form of O ) produced per C fixed by photosynthesis.

CCT562	The growth rate and photosynthetic properties (α Ã , P m Ã , E c and E k ) we observed for C. wighamii were similar to published values [43], but expanded on these by including the interaction effect between light and temperature, and also including different nutrient limitation. Generally, the decreasing α Ã and P m Ã and increasing E c and E k can be expected when the cells stated to experience nutrient stress and optimizing photosynthetic production becomes less important. An apparent paradox was the difference between N and P limitation, where P limitation seemingly affect α Ã and P m Ã more than N limitation. Photosynthetic pigments contain N but no P, so intuitively this seems like a contradiction. However, both of these photosynthetic parameters were normalized to Chl a, which is the norm in the literature [11], and normalizing to POC instead yields an opposite result where α and P m under N limitation are approximately half of that under P limitation. This highlight the importance of considering the biomass currency used to compare data. The most surprising finding was the low (<1) PQ values at nutrient and light limitation. For Pycnococcus provasolii it has been shown that the PQ was affected by both light acclimation and incubation light intensity #CITATION_TAG; where decreasing growth light decreased the PQ. The lowest PQ recorded by Iriarte [44] was 0.7, and this low value was suggested to be caused by an underestimation of O 2 production due to photorespiration. Photorespiration is a net loss process where O 2 replaces CO at the rubisco enzyme catalyzing the carbon fixation, resulting in consumption of 3 O 2 for every CO 2 produced [45]. Photorespiration may serve a function, such as a protective mechanism to avoid reactive oxygen species during photosynthesis [46], or in the assimilation of nitrate [47].	1	However, both of these photosynthetic parameters were normalized to Chl a, which is the norm in the literature [11], and normalizing to POC instead yields an opposite result where α and P m under N limitation are approximately half of that under P limitation.

Typically, the ratio of C:N:P increase as C fixation continues for some time after cells have stopped dividing, which is supported by our observations.

CCT571	The growth rate and photosynthetic properties (α Ã , P m Ã , E c and E k ) we observed for C. wighamii were similar to published values #CITATION_TAG, but expanded on these by including the interaction effect between light and temperature, and also including different nutrient limitation. Generally, the decreasing α Ã and P m Ã and increasing E c and E k can be expected when the cells stated to experience nutrient stress and optimizing photosynthetic production becomes less important. An apparent paradox was the difference between N and P limitation, where P limitation seemingly affect α Ã and P m Ã more than N limitation. Photosynthetic pigments contain N but no P, so intuitively this seems like a contradiction. However, both of these photosynthetic parameters were normalized to Chl a, which is the norm in the literature [11], and normalizing to POC instead yields an opposite result where α and P m under N limitation are approximately half of that under P limitation. This highlight the importance of considering the biomass currency used to compare data. The most surprising finding was the low (<1) PQ values at nutrient and light limitation. For Pycnococcus provasolii it has been shown that the PQ was affected by both light acclimation and incubation light intensity [44]; where decreasing growth light decreased the PQ. The lowest PQ recorded by Iriarte [44] was 0.7, and this low value was suggested to be caused by an underestimation of O 2 production due to photorespiration. Photorespiration is a net loss process where O 2 replaces CO at the rubisco enzyme catalyzing the carbon fixation, resulting in consumption of 3 O 2 for every CO 2 produced [45]. Photorespiration may serve a function, such as a protective mechanism to avoid reactive oxygen species during photosynthesis [46], or in the assimilation of nitrate [47].	1	The growth rate and photosynthetic properties (α Ã , P m Ã , E c and E k ) we observed for C. wighamii were similar to published values #CITATION_TAG, but expanded on these by including the interaction effect between light and temperature, and also including different nutrient limitation.

CCT574	The interplay between environmental factors such as light, temperature and nutrient availability and the physiology of the cell determines the growth rate and stoichiometric composition of the major elements in algae. Traditionally factors such as the growth-limiting nutrient have been used to model nutrient uptake and growth [27], and recent advances have started to incorporate uptake-protein regulation into this equation [28]#CITATION_TAG. The latter is an important step  as it incorporates the nutrient history of the primary producers, which is decisive in regulating the uptake rate determined by e.g. the number of uptake sites. The present data support the growing understanding of the interaction between fundamental abiotic parameters that should be included in growth models. Geider and La Roche [30] pointed out in their review on algal stoichiometry that relatively few studies examine the phenotypic flexibility in C:N:P during exponential growth and that more studies are needed in order to better understand the effect of temperature and light on these ratios. Under nutrient replete conditions the variability in the C:N:P ratio is normally larger between different species than between different environmental conditions such as variation in temperature [30]. Our data support this to some extent, as there was low variability in the C:N during active growth. However, C:P and N:P was twofold different between the lowest and highest value. The larger variability in C:P and N:P was caused by high P content relative to C and N at low light and temperature acclimation. Strong latitudinal patterns in the C:N:P ratio was recently described, and a lower than average ratio was associated with high latitudes [31]. Martiny et al. [31] suggested this lower C:N:P ratio to be caused by the largely diatom dominated communities present in cold water, but diatoms have also been associated with higher C:N:P ratio [32]. Our results here imply that there is a temperature effect, with lower C: N:P in low temperature and light.	0	The interplay between environmental factors such as light, temperature and nutrient availability and the physiology of the cell determines the growth rate and stoichiometric composition of the major elements in algae.

Light was provided using a 16:8 hour light-dark cycle. The flasks were held in a temperature-regulated water bath and irradiance was adjusted with neutral density screens. The cultures were kept in suspension by bubbling with pre-filtered (0.2 μm) air. Growth was monitored daily by counting cells with a FlowCam (FluidImaging), which collects micrographs of individual cells passing through a flow cuvette. The growth rate was calculated from a linear fit to natural logarithm (ln) transformed cell numbers, and all the fits are presented in the supporting information (S1 Fig) . The first set of measurements of particulate organic carbon (POC), nitrogen (PON) and phosphorus (POP), chlorophyll a (Chl a) and photosynthesis-irradiance (PE) curves were obtained during exponential growth. The biomass during the exponential growth sampling was approximately 1000 μmol POC L -1 and 500 μg Chl a L -1 , which was approximately 10% of the maximum (in terms of POC) during the stationary growth phase.	5	Chaetoceros wighamii was adopted from the culture collection of the Tvärminne Zoological Station (strain TVCWI) and cultured in T2 medium at 6 PSU, which is a modified f/2 medium #CITATION_TAG with N:Si:P nutrient ratios adjusted to 16:8:1, previously suggested to be close to optimal for this diatom [18].

The lowest PQ recorded by Iriarte [44] was 0.7, and this low value was suggested to be caused by an underestimation of O 2 production due to photorespiration. Photorespiration is a net loss process where O 2 replaces CO at the rubisco enzyme catalyzing the carbon fixation, resulting in consumption of 3 O 2 for every CO 2 produced [45]. Photorespiration may serve a function, such as a protective mechanism to avoid reactive oxygen species during photosynthesis [46], or in the assimilation of nitrate #CITATION_TAG.	0	For Pycnococcus provasolii it has been shown that the PQ was affected by both light acclimation and incubation light intensity [44]; where decreasing growth light decreased the PQ.

CCT592	Social well-being might be considered distinct from psychological well-being. Whereas psychological well-being reflects how content we are with ourselves, social well-being reveals how we interact with other people and with our community. 5][46] This perceived feeling of being unattractive and different to other people is made worse by the expression of supposed societal norms, through peer group pressure and images in the media. The awkwardness that young people feel about the appearance of their teeth leads to various coping strategies in social situations, including not showing their teeth when they smile, avoiding having their photograph taken and embarrassment when their photographs are shared through social media. It can also lead to approaches designed to hide their teeth, including placing their hand across their mouth when they smile. 46 e view of young people that others perceive them differently due to the appearance of their teeth has, to a certain extent, been confirmed by the work of Shaw. Using a technique of altering the arrangements of the teeth on standardised photographs of young people smiling, Shaw and colleagues showed that the appearance of teeth could influence the social judgements made by their peers about the person in the photograph #CITATION_TAG,48 ; however dental appearance did not affect the judgements made by teachers. The influence of dental appearance could, however, be surpassed by the overall attractiveness of the face. 47,48,50 T 2][53][54][55][56][57] Victims are particularly concerned when they are teased about the appearance of their teeth 51 and orthodontic treatment can help to alleviate this. 58 search is now focussed on ways of measuring the physical, functional, emotional and social impacts of conditions s daily life through the various concepts of quality of life, health and oral health-related quality of life.	0	The awkwardness that young people feel about the appearance of their teeth leads to various coping strategies in social situations, including not showing their teeth when they smile, avoiding having their photograph taken and embarrassment when their photographs are shared through social media.

We use the term scenario to describe a plausible, comprehensive, integrated and consistent description of how the future might unfold (#CITATION_TAG et al. 2000) while refraining from a concrete statement on probability. The term scenario specifically refers to integration of socio-economic, climate change, and climate change policy assumptions within the cells of the matrix. In contrast, the term pathway is used for the conditions describing the rows and columns of the matrix (e.g., the RCPs and SSPs). In other words, the term pathway emphasizes that these conditions are not comprehensive scenarios, but are focused on a specific component of the future (climate change or socio-economic circumstances). Only when combined can they provide the basis of an integrated scenario. The word pathway also emphasizes the time-dependent nature of the conditions.	0	It is worth clarifying the distinction between the terms scenario and pathway in the matrix architecture.

CCT614	One important use of the matrix structure is as a heuristic tool, classifying typical published examples of combinations of factors that are crucial for adaptation and mitigation. By locating studies in different cells of the matrix, these studies can more readily be compared and evaluated. For example, let us assume that different studies have estimated the costs of mitigation policy for a wide range of different baselines. Such scenarios may include some with high technology development and global cooperation and others with slow technology development and little global cooperation. Classifying scenarios from the literature within the matrix might in that case allow researchers to account for these differences and thus compare scenarios with similar assumptions. Something similar was done in the IPCC Fig. 6 Illustrations of how the matrix architecture can be used to look into the cost and benefits of climate policy (indicated by the different colours). Different categories of climate policy costs and residual impacts are expected to vary across the cells of the matrix. The empty cell (dashed lines) illustrate that not all combinations of forcing levels and SSPs may be consistent. Colours in the left hand matrix illustrate how achievement of lower forcing levels imposes a greater mitigation cost for any given SSP, but that this cost also depends on the SSP being followed. Colours in the right hand matrix suggest how the costs of avoiding a certain amount of impact (not specified here) through adaptation, combined with the impact costs that remain, are greater under some SSPs than others and under higher levels of forcing. The use of the framework to explore mitigation and adaptation policies is further elaborated in Kriegler et al. (Submitted for publication in this special issue). The 3.7 W/m2 level has been added to illustrate that other levels of radiative forcing than the four RCPs may also be explored Fourth Assessment Report, when scenarios were classified on the basis of resemblance to one of the SRES scenarios when accounting for costs (Fisher et al. 2007). This also could be done for impacts or adaptation studies: the SSPs and the matrix can help classify studies in a common way and provide a framework for communication across various communities. Obviously, using the framework as a heuristic tool requires that criteria be established to determine whether a scenario aligns with a specific SSP and/or with different forcing levels. It is possible to establish quantitative criteria that define a space around an SSP, as was done for the harmonized scenarios in the SRES (Nakicenovic et al. 2000). In that sense, it is also useful to use the earlier published quantifications of scenarios (#CITATION_TAG et al. 2005;van Vuuren et al. 2012a) that identify scenario archetypes across assessments.	5	This also could be done for impacts or adaptation studies: the SSPs and the matrix can help classify studies in a common way and provide a framework for communication across various communities.

CCT615	"The vertical axis in the scenario framework is defined in terms of RCPs, i.e. the level of radiative forcing. There are large uncertainties surrounding model projections of future climate for a given level of radiative forcing, due to factors such as the inherent unpredictability of natural climatic variations, global climate sensitivity in response to anthropogenic forcing and regional patterns of climate response (#CITATION_TAG et al. 2007;Meehl et al. 2007; Tebaldi and Arblaster, Submitted for publication in this special issue; Van Vuuren et al. 2008). Regional projections of some climatic variables (such as precipitation and wind speed), which can be crucially important for impacts in certain sectors and systems, are even more uncertain than projections of others (such as air temperature). This is also true for the timing, pattern, frequency, duration, and intensity of weather events, which provides critical information for impacts assessments. Together, this implies that a specific climate model projection for a given RCP level might differ greatly from the projection from another climate model for the same forcing. This ""climate change"" uncertainty can be regarded as another axis of the framework (Fig. 3). It is important to address this uncertainty as much as possible by using a large range of ESM outputs (or pattern scaling results, see Tebaldi and Arblaster, Submitted for publication in this special issue). While analysts are increasingly applying multi-model ensemble climate projections in impact studies (e.g. Araújo and New, 2007;Diffenbaugh and Field, 2013), this is not always feasible. One way to handle the Fig. 2 The policy assumptions may vary within a SSP. Therefore, it can be defined as an additional axis within the framework. Shared policy reference assumptions (SPAs) to characterize the policy context are discussed in Kriegler et al. (Submitted for publication in this special issue). Examples of such SPAs are assumptions on mitigation policy (e.g. uniform carbon price versus detailed regulation) and adaptation policy (e.g. the level of international cooperation). Clearly, relationships exist between the SSP, the policy assumptions, and the forcing level climate uncertainty while limiting the number of IAV calculations might be by identifying expected ""best case"" and ""worst case"" scenarios for specific purposes. For instance, if changes in precipitation are known to be a key determinant of agricultural impacts in a region, it is possible to identify, for a specific forcing level, climate models projecting the highest and lowest level of precipitation change in that region. Such methods are commonly applied in IAVanalysis, although multiple criteria are normally applied in determining the final selection of representative climate scenarios to be used (IPCC-TGICA 2007;Wilby et al. 2009). Further guidelines on this would clearly be useful in application of the overall framework."	2	The vertical axis in the scenario framework is defined in terms of RCPs, i.e. the level of radiative forcing.

CCT619	We updated the systematic review by Neville et al. (33) by including 5 additional studies (Table 5) (191)(192)#CITATION_TAG(194)(195). In the review by Neville et al., the majority of identified studies reported little or no association between breastfeeding and weight change. Of those five studies, three studies were performed in low-and middle-income countries, one was performed in high-income country, and one was multicentre study (Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman, USA). In studies performed in low-and middle-income countries, we have not found any potential differential effect for breastfeeding and postpartum weight loss response as a function of countries being low to middle and high income. Two of the five additionally identified studies (194,195) reported a significant reduction in postpartum weight with breastfeeding. Sarkar and Taylor (191) in a cross-sectional study in Bangladesh revealed that body weight of mothers was negatively correlated with 1-12 and 13-24 months of lactation after controlling for height, education and food consumption. Stuebe et al. (192) showed that women who exclusively breastfed for greater than six months had the lowest BMI at 3 years postpartum as well as the lowest postpartum weight retention at 3 years compared with women who never exclusively breastfed. A multicentre study showed that lactation intensity and duration explained little variation in weight change patterns (193)(194)(195). Overall, the role of breastfeeding on postpartum weight change remains unclear.	5	We updated the systematic review by Neville et al.

In particular we focus on the unexplored HL task, finding that only twenty papers provide enough information to be included in the survey out of more than five hundreds studies that cite #CITATION_TAG and Laury (2002). This is due to the fact that the HL procedure is widely used as a companion task in experimental sessions in which the core treatments deal with other topics involving uncertainty. As a consequence, only a small fraction of contributions explicitly report about gender differences. We hence move beyond a simple meta-analysis to carry out a wide-range investigation based on the largest possible set of microdata, generated by directly asking for data the authors of all the 94 published HL replications.	2	The goal of this paper is to try to fill these gaps.

CCT625	Gender differences in risk preferences are often seen as a stylized fact in the economics and psychology literature. Most of the studies and meta-analyses find that women display a more prudent behavior than men when confronted with decisions under risk.

CCT626	Our results indicate that the frequency and the importance of gender differences reflect specific characteristics of the elicitation methods over and above true differences in the underlying (and latent) risk attitudes. Observing a gender gap not only depends on the task being contextual or not (#CITATION_TAG and Grossman, 2008a), on it having to do with risk or with uncertainty (Wieland and Sarin, 2012), or on the choices being incentivized, self-reported or observed (Byrnes et al., 1999). Even restricting the analysis to the narrow domain of incentivized lottery choice tasks currently used in experimental economics, gender differences depend on the details of the task. We single out two characteristics that jointly correlate with the likelihood of observing gender differences: a) the presence of a safe option within the choice set, and b) the use of lotteries with 50% − 50% fixed probabilities in tasks that generate the menu of lotteries changing the amounts at stake.	1	Our results indicate that the frequency and the importance of gender differences reflect specific characteristics of the elicitation methods over and above true differences in the underlying (and latent) risk attitudes.

CCT627	The overall frequency of inconsistent choices has already been summarized in Table 4. In Table 7 we provide a more detailed picture showing a breakdown by gender and type of inconsistency. The Table displays the number of inconsistent choices, overall and by gender, out of the total number that can be potentially observed. For instance, multiple switching cannot be observed in papers in which a single switching decision is imposed by design. Always choosing the safer (riskier) lottery is a dominated action only if there is a choice in which the good outcome has probability one (zero). 9 ultiple switching is the most common type of inconsistent behavior, observed about 14% of the times. Females are significantly more likely to be inconsistent (Fisher Exact test p < 0.001) and this at first glance seems to aim at numeracy as a possible explanation. These differences survive also in a multivariate framework in which other possible determinants  are included. In particular, presenting the lotteries in random order dramatically increases the fraction of inconsistencies. The number of choices in the price list also significantly increases inconsistencies, although to a much lower extent, while the presence of monetary incentives significantly reduces them. Inconsistent subjects make on average 5.15 safe choices, without significant gender differences (Mann Whitney test, p = 0.67). This number is lower than that of consistent subjects (5.63), and significantly so (Mann Whitney test, p < 0.001). At first glance this seems to suggest that inconsistent subjects tend to systematically bias downward the number of safe choices. However, a more careful interpretation suggests that inconsistent subjects simply tend to make choices that are closer to a random decision, which in the framework of the HL task coincides with choosing each option half of the times. This interpretation suggests that the positive correlation between risk aversion and IQ emphasized, among others, by #CITATION_TAG et al. (2010), could be an artifact of the format of the price list, as already argued by Andersson et al. (2013). Dominated choices (choosing always safe or always risky when certain outcomes exist) are much less frequent. Gender in this case does not help explaining the results, and neither do the other determinants, with the exception of incentives that also reduce the likelihood of making a safe choice when the good outcome is certain.	0	This number is lower than that of consistent subjects (5.63), and significantly so (Mann Whitney test, p < 0.001).

CCT635	Not all of the green space in pre-industrial urban landscapes, however, was used to produce food. For example, open spaces have often been used as religious sites and as cemeteries. In many cities, particularly European, pleasure parks and pleasure gardens for purely recreational uses have also been present in cities since millennia, but these have mainly been the privilege of emperors, kings and other urban elites. In Stockholm, for instance, ordinary citizens were not allowed to enter such parks and gardens until the mid-1700s (#CITATION_TAG et al. 2005 ). The main social drivers that led to a shift toward public use of such green spaces were the rapid urbanization during the industrial revolution, in combination with emerging social values inspired by the Romantic Movement and the French Revolution (Barthel et al. 2005 ). However, clear delineations between urban and rural areas and use of urban green spaces for purely recreational purposes did not emerge until the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and were reinforced by the development of a globalized economy, the fossil fuel energy regime, and technological innovations such as the steam engine and the railway (McNeill 2000 ;Barthel and Isendahl 2012 ;Barthel et al. 2013 ). Across Swedish cities, urban food production was ubiquitous until the development of the railway network, and the towns were in fact producing 50 % of their food consumption within their boundaries, and some were producing much more. For instance, in the mid-1700s, Uppsala produced more food than the city dwellers themselves consumed and the surplus was exported outside the city (Björklund 2009 ). However, the mental models that developed among urban theorists in the beginning of the 1900s soon excluded the rural aspects of life in the city. One example is the Chicago School of urban sociology. Based in ecological theory (cf. Clements 1916 ) and using Chicago as a case study, the Chicago School of urban sociology emerged in the 1920s and 1930s to establish a modernist understanding of urban life as separate from rural life (McDonnell 2011 ). The idea of cities as separate entities essentially detached from their broader life-support systems (Wirth 1938 ) was strongly linked to major innovations in transportation technology as Chicago became an important hub in the U.S. railroad network in the 1850s, and food transportation over great distances became possible. Establishment as a railroad hub enabled Chicago to grow rapidly from a few thousand inhabitants in the 1850s to over two million in the early 1920s. Industrial-era technological innovation, cheap and effi cient travel, and economic growth (opening new markets, speeding up production cycles, and reducing the turnover time of capital) catered for the fi rst wave of space-time compression 1 (Harvey 1990 ). Hence, the modernist ideology underpinning the emergence of urban planning during the early decades of the 1900s distinctly separated local agricultures and other rural dimensions as obsolete in futuristic and normative understandings of the city as an autonomous social system (Barthel and Isendahl 2012 ).	0	Not all of the green space in pre-industrial urban landscapes, however, was used to produce food.

CCT636	"A different type of sprawl characterized the layout of other ancient cities where residences were interspersed among agricultural plots in an extensive low-density continuum surrounding central institutional buildings and monuments. Scholars have identifi ed this settlement structure among the cities of the Khmer of early medieval Cambodia, the classic Maya of Central America, and some precolonial African societies (Evans et al. 2007 ;Scarborough et al. 2012 ;Simon 2008 ). The capital city of the Khmer, Angkor, is well known for its central temples and massive hydraulic works, but it was supported by a vast sprawl of residences, farm plots, local ponds, and an infrastructure that tied together roughly 1,000 km 2 of low density urbanism (Evans et al. 2007 ). Low density urbanism also characterized many of the major Mayan cities, such as Tikal in Guatemala and Caracol in Belize, where major constructions of temples, pyramids and palaces in a central location  were surrounded by a vast spread of housing complexes, agricultural plots, and an infrastructure of roads, causeways, and reservoirs tying them together (Scarborough et al. 2012 ).

CCT637	Ancient Mayan Cities . Cities in Meso-America traded a variety of food commodities both short-and long-distance (Dunning 2004 ;Isendahl 2006 ), but seasonally impassable rivers and energetically costly overland transports put a relatively high cost on trade and inhibited bulk-staple exchange (Isendahl 2006(#CITATION_TAG , 2012. Hence, much of the food consumed by the urban Maya Indians came from proximate lands (Isendahl 2006(Isendahl , 2012. For instance, large sectors of fertile soils inside the urban landscape were devoid of settlement constructions, but were used as city infi elds (Isendahl 2012 ). The management of these infi elds in Mayan cities was markedly different from the larger and stateowned farmstead gardens (Barthel and Isendahl 2012 ;Isendahl 2012 ), which were put under tremendous pressure when competition between city-states intensifi ed, a condition which at least partly contributed to the collapse of Mayan cities in the tenth century AD (Tainter 2011 ). The infi elds were used as household farmstead gardens, which concentrated agricultural knowledge and stewardship of the agricultural biodiversity that was the ultimate survival strategy for the populace (Ford and Emery 2008 ). Owing to residential proximity it was most carefully tended, and most carefully fertilized by the organic waste concentrated by city dwellers, and was used for plant breeding, experimentation, and for seed storage (Ford and Nigh 2009 ). The household farmstead garden held the key to a resilient fl ow of urban ecosystem services and provided food security for the population (Barthel and Isendahl 2012 ). Remnant urban ecosystems and the rich levels of biodiversity found in the urban Yucatan today are hence viewed to be the products of a millennia-long co-evolution in cultural landscapes (Ford and Emery 2008 ;Ford and Nigh 2009 ).

CCT643	"During the previously described long stretch of history, societies and economies were not growing very quickly (Fig. 2.1 ). However, since the beginning of the industrial revolution, and especially after the start of the ""great acceleration"" following the end of WWII, there has been rapid economic expansion coupled with rapid urban growth-all driven by rapid expansion of fossil fuel use, especially oil (Costanza et al. 2007b ). Indeed, one of the hallmarks of contemporary urbanization is that urban areas are growing faster and larger than they did in the past as well in new geographic locations (Seto et al. 2012b ) (Chap. 21 ). Current mainstream concepts and models of the economy were developed in this period of rapid expansion as if the world we lived in had unlimited capacity for growth in the material economy. In this ""empty world"" context, built capital -the houses, roads, and factoriesthings that are concentrated in cities-was the limiting factor to improving human well-being. Natural capital -our ecological life support system-and social capitalour myriad relationships with each other-were viewed to be abundant (#CITATION_TAG et al. 1997a ). It made sense in this context not to worry too much about environmental and social ""externalities"" -effects that occurred outside the market-since they could be assumed to be relatively small and ultimately solvable. Instead, the focus was on the growth of the market economy, as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP), as a primary means to improve human welfare. The dominant thinking categorized the economy as only marketed goods and services and the goal of society was simply increasing the amount of these goods and services produced and consumed (Costanza et al. 1997a ). We now live in an interconnected global system that is relatively full of humans and their artifacts (Fig. 2.1 ) in what some are even calling a new geologic era-the ""Anthropocene"" (Crutzen 2002 ;Steffen et al. 2011 )-and have shifted into a human-dominated planet and into a new full-world context (Daly 2005 ). Some have also argued that we have already moved beyond the ""Anthropocene"" into the new urban era (Seto et al. 2010 ;Ljungqvist et al. 2010 ). Now we have to think differently about the relationship between humans and the rest of nature. If we seek ""improved human well-being and social equity, while signifi cantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities,"" as the UN has recently proclaimed as the primary global goal (UNEP 2011 ), we will need a new vision of the economy and of cities and their relationship to the rest of the world that is better adapted to the new conditions we face. We will require a vision of the economy and urbanization that reintroduces the ecology of the urban. Material consumption and GDP are merely means to that end, not ends in themselves, and we need to better understand what really does contribute to sustainable human well-being (SHW), and recognize the substantial contributions of natural and social capital, which are now the limiting factors to improving SHW in many countries. We must be able to distinguish between real poverty in terms of low SHW and merely low monetary income."	0	"21 ).

CCT644	"The landscape-productivity-human relationship evolved in villages and towns; this enabled the growth of large, diverse populations that would aggregate into what are now called cities. The cities of antiquity in Mesopotamia and other regions responded to the specifi c opportunities and constraints of their local social and ecological environment, yet general patterns emerged that share commonality with contemporary cities and may provide useful insights (#CITATION_TAG 2008 ;Smith 2012 ). The hallmarks of cities are: (a) a large population that (b) aggregates in a central location with (c) buildings and monuments that (d) represent institutions that organize and facilitate productivity. From the earliest times in Mesopotamia and in other regions, aggregations of people and their wealth have been threatened by military hostilities and they have repeatedly sought refuge behind strong defensive fortifi cations (Redman 1978 ). This has led to densely packed cities behind defensive walls, but at the same time growing rural to urban migration has led to settlements spreading outside the walls, a phenomenon that today one might call sprawl. This pattern of densely packed housing and central institutions within the walls, and residential settlement spreading far beyond the walls was frequent in the Near East, Asia, and Medieval Europe (Boone and Modarres 2006 ). In fact, Marco Polo reported that around the Mongol capital that would eventually become Beijing, ""There is a suburb outside each of the gates, which are 12 in number, and these suburbs are so great that they contain more people than the city itself"" (reported in ."	5	The landscape-productivity-human relationship evolved in villages and towns; this enabled the growth of large, diverse populations that would aggregate into what are now called cities.

CCT645	Not all of the green space in pre-industrial urban landscapes, however, was used to produce food. For example, open spaces have often been used as religious sites and as cemeteries. In many cities, particularly European, pleasure parks and pleasure gardens for purely recreational uses have also been present in cities since millennia, but these have mainly been the privilege of emperors, kings and other urban elites. In Stockholm, for instance, ordinary citizens were not allowed to enter such parks and gardens until the mid-1700s (Barthel et al. 2005 ). The main social drivers that led to a shift toward public use of such green spaces were the rapid urbanization during the industrial revolution, in combination with emerging social values inspired by the Romantic Movement and the French Revolution (Barthel et al. 2005 ). However, clear delineations between urban and rural areas and use of urban green spaces for purely recreational purposes did not emerge until the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and were reinforced by the development of a globalized economy, the fossil fuel energy regime, and technological innovations such as the steam engine and the railway (McNeill 2000 ;Barthel and Isendahl 2012 ;Barthel et al. 2013 ). Across Swedish cities, urban food production was ubiquitous until the development of the railway network, and the towns were in fact producing 50 % of their food consumption within their boundaries, and some were producing much more. For instance, in the mid-1700s, Uppsala produced more food than the city dwellers themselves consumed and the surplus was exported outside the city (Björklund 2009 ). However, the mental models that developed among urban theorists in the beginning of the 1900s soon excluded the rural aspects of life in the city. One example is the Chicago School of urban sociology. Based in ecological theory (cf. Clements 1916 ) and using Chicago as a case study, the Chicago School of urban sociology emerged in the 1920s and 1930s to establish a modernist understanding of urban life as separate from rural life (McDonnell 2011 ). The idea of cities as separate entities essentially detached from their broader life-support systems (#CITATION_TAG 1938 ) was strongly linked to major innovations in transportation technology as Chicago became an important hub in the U.S. railroad network in the 1850s, and food transportation over great distances became possible. Establishment as a railroad hub enabled Chicago to grow rapidly from a few thousand inhabitants in the 1850s to over two million in the early 1920s. Industrial-era technological innovation, cheap and effi cient travel, and economic growth (opening new markets, speeding up production cycles, and reducing the turnover time of capital) catered for the fi rst wave of space-time compression 1 (Harvey 1990 ). Hence, the modernist ideology underpinning the emergence of urban planning during the early decades of the 1900s distinctly separated local agricultures and other rural dimensions as obsolete in futuristic and normative understandings of the city as an autonomous social system (Barthel and Isendahl 2012 ).	0	However, the mental models that developed among urban theorists in the beginning of the 1900s soon excluded the rural aspects of life in the city.

CCT646	Although there is great variation between different urban histories, large numbers of people aggregating into cities generally allowed for specialization of labor and other effi ciencies of scale. This often generated the outcome that a large proportion of urban people were no longer self-suffi cient in food production and hence, a greater proportion of people elsewhere in rural areas were be responsible for growing food for themselves, for the people in the city, and enough to monetarily offset the cost of transport and distribution. This put a tremendous burden on rural farming communities to produce much more than they would if solely working to supply enough for themselves. As the societal roles of the urban and rural populations grew increasingly different and complex, the objectives and understandings of these populations changed as well. Farmers experienced a shift away from traditional practices of the earlier village-farming era, in which they would have more intimately understood the landscape and productive systems and would have been inclined toward conservation practices wherein they balanced extractive activities with the regenerative capabilities of the land. The urban elite also experienced a shift away from traditional subsistence practices, and began to focus on the net produce they were able to extract from the countryside (or urban industries) and insisted on maximum production with little knowledge of, or concern for, the potential deleterious effects on the rural landscape (#CITATION_TAG and Adams 1958 ;Redman 1999 ). However, the disregard for local dynamics of ecological integrity was not simply the product of urban demand; rural land owners, and national and transnational agricultural businesses were also instrumental in the alienation of food production from the carrying capacity of land. The rise of population that the enhanced production of food facilitated was not accompanied by innovation in trans-locational governance or in governance regimes that integrated cities and their hinterlands. In an ideal hierarchical society, even though decision-making authority would be concentrated at the top, one could assume that knowledge would travel up the hierarchy, and that informed decisions and concern would be displayed by decisions that traveled down the hierarchy. This was, however, seldom the case, and rather the dominant pattern was of maximizing short-term returns with little concern for long-term consequences. In many instances, archaeological evidence attests to the intense environmental degradation in the regions around ancient cities, and one can see the impact of urban demand on the rural countryside continuing today (Diamond 2005 ;Redman 1999 ) (Fig. 2.2 ). In Chap s. 22 and 26 , we highlight the impact of the rising urban demand for food that is resulting in a competition for agricultural land; this competition is a global trend in land use that is largely unregulated.	0	This put a tremendous burden on rural farming communities to produce much more than they would if solely working to supply enough for themselves.

Some have also argued that we have already moved beyond the ""Anthropocene"" into the new urban era (Seto et al. 2010 ;Ljungqvist et al. 2010 ). Now we have to think differently about the relationship between humans and the rest of nature. If we seek ""improved human well-being and social equity, while signifi cantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities,"" as the UN has recently proclaimed as the primary global goal (UNEP 2011 ), we will need a new vision of the economy and of cities and their relationship to the rest of the world that is better adapted to the new conditions we face. We will require a vision of the economy and urbanization that reintroduces the ecology of the urban. Material consumption and GDP are merely means to that end, not ends in themselves, and we need to better understand what really does contribute to sustainable human well-being (SHW), and recognize the substantial contributions of natural and social capital, which are now the limiting factors to improving SHW in many countries.

CCT650	"Examining events and processes in the past often will provide useful insights into the origin of driving forces that impact cities today. However, the productive relationships that underlie the growth and success of cities may at the same time lead to relationships that are maladaptive, creating increased long term risks. For example, the concept of private property emerged to replace weak sense of ownership, lack of ownership, and/or the concept of community ownership. Farmers were increasingly able both to produce more food than their family required and they found ways to store this surplus for trade or for guarding against future bad harvests. However, one could only eat so much and a variety of factors limited the amount of food that could be effectively stored, including the ability of landlords and elites to appropriate some of the surplus through taxes. Hence the stimulus to produce a surplus remained limited in most farming villages. What changed this relationship, and is key to the growth of urban society, is the ability to transform locally produced surplus food into enduring prestige items associated with elevated status. This could only take place under a new social order that acknowledged classes with differential wealth, access to productive resources, power, and status.

CCT651	Not all of the green space in pre-industrial urban landscapes, however, was used to produce food. For example, open spaces have often been used as religious sites and as cemeteries. In many cities, particularly European, pleasure parks and pleasure gardens for purely recreational uses have also been present in cities since millennia, but these have mainly been the privilege of emperors, kings and other urban elites. In Stockholm, for instance, ordinary citizens were not allowed to enter such parks and gardens until the mid-1700s (Barthel et al. 2005 ). The main social drivers that led to a shift toward public use of such green spaces were the rapid urbanization during the industrial revolution, in combination with emerging social values inspired by the Romantic Movement and the French Revolution (Barthel et al. 2005 ). However, clear delineations between urban and rural areas and use of urban green spaces for purely recreational purposes did not emerge until the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and were reinforced by the development of a globalized economy, the fossil fuel energy regime, and technological innovations such as the steam engine and the railway (#CITATION_TAG 2000 ;Barthel and Isendahl 2012 ;Barthel et al. 2013 ). Across Swedish cities, urban food production was ubiquitous until the development of the railway network, and the towns were in fact producing 50 % of their food consumption within their boundaries, and some were producing much more. For instance, in the mid-1700s, Uppsala produced more food than the city dwellers themselves consumed and the surplus was exported outside the city (Björklund 2009 ). However, the mental models that developed among urban theorists in the beginning of the 1900s soon excluded the rural aspects of life in the city. One example is the Chicago School of urban sociology. Based in ecological theory (cf. Clements 1916 ) and using Chicago as a case study, the Chicago School of urban sociology emerged in the 1920s and 1930s to establish a modernist understanding of urban life as separate from rural life (McDonnell 2011 ). The idea of cities as separate entities essentially detached from their broader life-support systems (Wirth 1938 ) was strongly linked to major innovations in transportation technology as Chicago became an important hub in the U.S. railroad network in the 1850s, and food transportation over great distances became possible. Establishment as a railroad hub enabled Chicago to grow rapidly from a few thousand inhabitants in the 1850s to over two million in the early 1920s. Industrial-era technological innovation, cheap and effi cient travel, and economic growth (opening new markets, speeding up production cycles, and reducing the turnover time of capital) catered for the fi rst wave of space-time compression 1 (Harvey 1990 ). Hence, the modernist ideology underpinning the emergence of urban planning during the early decades of the 1900s distinctly separated local agricultures and other rural dimensions as obsolete in futuristic and normative understandings of the city as an autonomous social system (Barthel and Isendahl 2012 ).	0	In many cities, particularly European, pleasure parks and pleasure gardens for purely recreational uses have also been present in cities since millennia, but these have mainly been the privilege of emperors, kings and other urban elites.

CCT659	Ancient Mayan Cities . Cities in Meso-America traded a variety of food commodities both short-and long-distance (Dunning 2004 ;Isendahl 2006 ), but seasonally impassable rivers and energetically costly overland transports put a relatively high cost on trade and inhibited bulk-staple exchange (Isendahl 2006(Isendahl , 2012. Hence, much of the food consumed by the urban Maya Indians came from proximate lands (Isendahl 2006(Isendahl , 2012. For instance, large sectors of fertile soils inside the urban landscape were devoid of settlement constructions, but were used as city infi elds (Isendahl 2012 ). The management of these infi elds in Mayan cities was markedly different from the larger and stateowned farmstead gardens (Barthel and Isendahl 2012 ;Isendahl 2012 ), which were put under tremendous pressure when competition between city-states intensifi ed, a condition which at least partly contributed to the collapse of Mayan cities in the tenth century AD (Tainter 2011 ). The infi elds were used as household farmstead gardens, which concentrated agricultural knowledge and stewardship of the agricultural biodiversity that was the ultimate survival strategy for the populace (Ford and Emery 2008 ). Owing to residential proximity it was most carefully tended, and most carefully fertilized by the organic waste concentrated by city dwellers, and was used for plant breeding, experimentation, and for seed storage (Ford and Nigh 2009 ). The household farmstead garden held the key to a resilient fl ow of urban ecosystem services and provided food security for the population (Barthel and Isendahl 2012 ).

CCT660	Not all of the green space in pre-industrial urban landscapes, however, was used to produce food. For example, open spaces have often been used as religious sites and as cemeteries. In many cities, particularly European, pleasure parks and pleasure gardens for purely recreational uses have also been present in cities since millennia, but these have mainly been the privilege of emperors, kings and other urban elites. In Stockholm, for instance, ordinary citizens were not allowed to enter such parks and gardens until the mid-1700s (Barthel et al. 2005 ). The main social drivers that led to a shift toward public use of such green spaces were the rapid urbanization during the industrial revolution, in combination with emerging social values inspired by the Romantic Movement and the French Revolution (Barthel et al. 2005 ). However, clear delineations between urban and rural areas and use of urban green spaces for purely recreational purposes did not emerge until the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and were reinforced by the development of a globalized economy, the fossil fuel energy regime, and technological innovations such as the steam engine and the railway (McNeill 2000 ;Barthel and Isendahl 2012 ;#CITATION_TAG et al. 2013 ). Across Swedish cities, urban food production was ubiquitous until the development of the railway network, and the towns were in fact producing 50 % of their food consumption within their boundaries, and some were producing much more. For instance, in the mid-1700s, Uppsala produced more food than the city dwellers themselves consumed and the surplus was exported outside the city (Björklund 2009 ). However, the mental models that developed among urban theorists in the beginning of the 1900s soon excluded the rural aspects of life in the city. One example is the Chicago School of urban sociology. Based in ecological theory (cf. Clements 1916 ) and using Chicago as a case study, the Chicago School of urban sociology emerged in the 1920s and 1930s to establish a modernist understanding of urban life as separate from rural life (McDonnell 2011 ). The idea of cities as separate entities essentially detached from their broader life-support systems (Wirth 1938 ) was strongly linked to major innovations in transportation technology as Chicago became an important hub in the U.S. railroad network in the 1850s, and food transportation over great distances became possible. Establishment as a railroad hub enabled Chicago to grow rapidly from a few thousand inhabitants in the 1850s to over two million in the early 1920s. Industrial-era technological innovation, cheap and effi cient travel, and economic growth (opening new markets, speeding up production cycles, and reducing the turnover time of capital) catered for the fi rst wave of space-time compression 1 (Harvey 1990 ). Hence, the modernist ideology underpinning the emergence of urban planning during the early decades of the 1900s distinctly separated local agricultures and other rural dimensions as obsolete in futuristic and normative understandings of the city as an autonomous social system (Barthel and Isendahl 2012 ).	0	In many cities, particularly European, pleasure parks and pleasure gardens for purely recreational uses have also been present in cities since millennia, but these have mainly been the privilege of emperors, kings and other urban elites.

CCT661	"The landscape-productivity-human relationship evolved in villages and towns; this enabled the growth of large, diverse populations that would aggregate into what are now called cities. The cities of antiquity in Mesopotamia and other regions responded to the specifi c opportunities and constraints of their local social and ecological environment, yet general patterns emerged that share commonality with contemporary cities and may provide useful insights (Simon 2008 ;Smith 2012 ). The hallmarks of cities are: (a) a large population that (b) aggregates in a central location with (c) buildings and monuments that (d) represent institutions that organize and facilitate productivity. From the earliest times in Mesopotamia and in other regions, aggregations of people and their wealth have been threatened by military hostilities and they have repeatedly sought refuge behind strong defensive fortifi cations (Redman 1978 ). This has led to densely packed cities behind defensive walls, but at the same time growing rural to urban migration has led to settlements spreading outside the walls, a phenomenon that today one might call sprawl. This pattern of densely packed housing and central institutions within the walls, and residential settlement spreading far beyond the walls was frequent in the Near East, Asia, and Medieval Europe (#CITATION_TAG and Modarres 2006 ). In fact, Marco Polo reported that around the Mongol capital that would eventually become Beijing, ""There is a suburb outside each of the gates, which are 12 in number, and these suburbs are so great that they contain more people than the city itself"" (reported in ."	0	"The hallmarks of cities are: (a) a large population that (b) aggregates in a central location with (c) buildings and monuments that (d) represent institutions that organize and facilitate productivity.

CCT662	A third approach to problem solving emerged, however, when larger populations required a transformation in the social order, which was largely achieved through innovations in social complexity. This is at the heart of what scholars call the Urban Revolution and it appears to have occurred fi rst in Mesopotamia (#CITATION_TAG 1950 ;Redman 1999 ). The formation of the fi rst cities and their linking together as one civilization on the Mesopotamian plain was relatively rapid, considering the scope of the social and technological changes involved. In about 5500 BC, only 2,000 years after the earliest known occupation of this region, cities emerged, and writing and other traits of urbanism such as monumental buildings and craft specialization had appeared. The rise of cities is not simply the growth of large collections of peoplerather, it involves communities that are far more diverse than their predecessors and more interdependent. Relative independence and self-suffi ciency characterized village farming communities, but it also limited their growth. Specialization in the production of various goods and complex exchange networks represented one way in which urban societies were able to grow. Cities were dependent on their hinterlands of surrounding towns and villages and developed ways to extract goods and services from their neighbors (see left panel in Fig. 2.2 ). It is clear that technological inventions such as effective irrigation agriculture, the manufacture and widespread exchange of goods, and the advance of science and mathematics were fundamental to the growth of cities. In turn, cities became and continue to be centers of innovation. Moreover, new inventions in the social realm, such as class-structured society, formalized systems of laws, and a hierarchical territorially-based government made cities possible and have continued to characterize their operation.	0	A third approach to problem solving emerged, however, when larger populations required a transformation in the social order, which was largely achieved through innovations in social complexity.

CCT664	"During the previously described long stretch of history, societies and economies were not growing very quickly (Fig. 2.1 ).

Indeed, one of the hallmarks of contemporary urbanization is that urban areas are growing faster and larger than they did in the past as well in new geographic locations (Seto et al. 2012b ) (Chap. 21 ).

Some have also argued that we have already moved beyond the ""Anthropocene"" into the new urban era (Seto et al. 2010 ;Ljungqvist et al. 2010 ).

If we seek ""improved human well-being and social equity, while signifi cantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities,"" as the UN has recently proclaimed as the primary global goal (UNEP 2011 ), we will need a new vision of the economy and of cities and their relationship to the rest of the world that is better adapted to the new conditions we face.

CCT666	Ancient Mayan Cities . Cities in Meso-America traded a variety of food commodities both short-and long-distance (Dunning 2004 ;Isendahl 2006 ), but seasonally impassable rivers and energetically costly overland transports put a relatively high cost on trade and inhibited bulk-staple exchange (Isendahl 2006(Isendahl , 2012. Hence, much of the food consumed by the urban Maya Indians came from proximate lands (Isendahl 2006(Isendahl , 2012. For instance, large sectors of fertile soils inside the urban landscape were devoid of settlement constructions, but were used as city infi elds (Isendahl 2012 ). The management of these infi elds in Mayan cities was markedly different from the larger and stateowned farmstead gardens (Barthel and Isendahl 2012 ;Isendahl 2012 ), which were put under tremendous pressure when competition between city-states intensifi ed, a condition which at least partly contributed to the collapse of Mayan cities in the tenth century AD (Tainter 2011 ). The infi elds were used as household farmstead gardens, which concentrated agricultural knowledge and stewardship of the agricultural biodiversity that was the ultimate survival strategy for the populace (Ford and Emery 2008 ). Owing to residential proximity it was most carefully tended, and most carefully fertilized by the organic waste concentrated by city dwellers, and was used for plant breeding, experimentation, and for seed storage (Ford and Nigh 2009 ). The household farmstead garden held the key to a resilient fl ow of urban ecosystem services and provided food security for the population (Barthel and Isendahl 2012 ). Remnant urban ecosystems and the rich levels of biodiversity found in the urban Yucatan today are hence viewed to be the products of a millennia-long co-evolution in cultural landscapes (Ford and Emery 2008 ;#CITATION_TAG and Nigh 2009 ).

It involves a term structure built from the backbone of an ordinal representation system that mimics the constructible hierarchy. For every theorem Σ theorem of IKP of the form ∃xA(x) one can effectively determine an ordinal α from the representation system (which is smaller than the Bachmann-Howard ordinal) and an infinitary cut-free derivation D α 0 ∃ xA(x). Since this is a derivation in infinitary intuitionistic logic one obtains from the proof an explicit term t in the term structure and a proof D ′ α 0 A (t). The canonical interpretation of t in the constructible hierarchy as defined in [31, 3.5 Soundness Theorem] then provides the explicit witness for ∃xA(x).

SBI fungicides have been shown to have no or    Species hypothesis accession codes in the UNITE 1 database version are indicated when available. Functional assignment as ""pathogen"" is only used for taxa known to be pathogenic on wheat. a moderate effect on the ""pink"" and ""white"" phyllosphere yeasts, with a somewhat stronger effect on ""white"" yeasts [16]. Aureobasidium pullulans is reported to be sensitive to propiconazole [16] and prochloraz [17,18] and these two fungicides and other SBI fungicides have been used in almost all the fields in this study (Table S1). The ascomycete A. pullulans is one of the most common inhabitants of the phyllosphere of many crops [48] and is also present in many other habitats [49]. Aureobasidium pullulans is known to be antagonistic towards necrotrophic pathogens, e.g. grey mould in strawberries [50] and powdery mildew in durum wheat [51]. The mechanism of the antagonism is hypothesised to be competition for nutrients #CITATION_TAG. Some strains of A. pullulans also produce a type of antibiotic called aureobasidins [53]. The antagonistic potential of biological control agents is frequently strain-specific, depending on the mechanism of antagonism. From the sequence data, we cannot make inferences about the antagonistic capacity of an OTU. Hence, it is unknown whether the reduction in the relative abundance of A. pullulans in fungicide-treated leaves has an impact on the antagonistic capacity of the fungal community. Several OTUs were identified as common wheat pathogens in the dataset: OTU_14_Mycosphaerella_graminicola, OTU_13_ Blumeria_graminis, OTU_1_Puccinia_striiformis, OTU_47_ Phaeosphaeria_nodorum (Parastagonospora nodorum), OTU_20_ Monographella_spp and OTU_224_Pyrenophora_tritici-repentis. Surprisingly, there was no significant effect of fungicide treatment on the relative abundance of any of these OTUs. On the contrary, there was a tendency for higher variability in the relative abundance of M. graminicola and B. graminis in treated samples (Fig. 6), and the share of B. graminis (the only member of Erysiphales) was larger in treated samples (Fig. 3). On the other hand, P. striiformis tended to dominate the fungal community in untreated samples and was nearly absent from the fungicidetreated samples from the same fields, only being present in two fields in the Southern area (Fig. 3). Fungicide resistance in common pathogens is an increasing problem and could be an explanation for the high variability in the relative abundance of the pathogens observed here. Resistance to strobilurines in M. graminicola and even more so in B. graminis is widespread in the Nordic and Baltic countries. In addition, resistance to demethylation inhibitor fungicides is increasing in both pathogens [10]. 454 sequencing is a semi-quantitative method only allowing quantification of the relative abundance of different OTUs [25].

The ascomycete A. pullulans is one of the most common inhabitants of the phyllosphere of many crops [48] and is also present in many other habitats [49]. Aureobasidium pullulans is known to be antagonistic towards necrotrophic pathogens, e.g. grey mould in strawberries [50] and powdery mildew in durum wheat [51]. The mechanism of the antagonism is hypothesised to be competition for nutrients #CITATION_TAG. Some strains of A. pullulans also produce a type of antibiotic called aureobasidins [53]. The antagonistic potential of biological control agents is frequently strain-specific, depending on the mechanism of antagonism. From the sequence data, we cannot make inferences about the antagonistic capacity of an OTU.	h

From the sequence data, we cannot make inferences about the antagonistic capacity of an OTU. Hence, it is unknown whether the reduction in the relative abundance of A. pullulans in fungicide-treated leaves has an impact on the antagonistic capacity of the fungal community. Several OTUs were identified as common wheat pathogens in the dataset: OTU_14_Mycosphaerella_graminicola, OTU_13_ Blumeria_graminis, OTU_1_Puccinia_striiformis, OTU_47_ Phaeosphaeria_nodorum (Parastagonospora nodorum), OTU_20_ Monographella_spp and OTU_224_Pyrenophora_tritici-repentis. Surprisingly, there was no significant effect of fungicide treatment on the relative abundance of any of these OTUs. On the contrary, there was a tendency for higher variability in the relative abundance of M. graminicola and B. graminis in treated samples (Fig. 6), and the share of B. graminis (the only member of Erysiphales) was larger in treated samples (Fig. 3). On the other hand, P. striiformis tended to dominate the fungal community in untreated samples and was nearly absent from the fungicidetreated samples from the same fields, only being present in two fields in the Southern area (Fig. 3).

CCT717	Story is a rich resource for literacy and provides abundant linguistic resources for students to learn a foreign language. Engaging interactively with stories allows EFL teachers and students not only to extend their language proficiency but also to develop emotional involvement with the target language (#CITATION_TAG, 2006). To engage EFL learners cognitively and affectively with story, it is argued that careful selection of story content should be made by focusing not only on linguistic resources but also on elements that might catch the interest of the students such as interesting characters, a clear plot and ending (Pinter, 2006). As such, through storying, EFL learners experience greater opportunity to develop their linguistic resources as well as a deeper understanding of the culture and people of the target language represented in the story.	4	Story is a rich resource for literacy and provides abundant linguistic resources for students to learn a foreign language.

CCT719	When designing a SVM, there are three crucial issues it should be taken into account: the type of SVM to use, the selection of the kernel function and tuning the parameters associated with the two previous selections. Since TSF is a particular regression case, for the SVM type and kernel, we selected the popular ε-insensitive loss function (known as ε-SVR) and Gaussian kernel combination, as implemented in the LIBSVM tool #CITATION_TAG. In SVM regression [17], the input y = (y t−kI , . . . , y t−k2 , y t−k1 ), for a SVM with I inputs, is transformed into a high m-dimensional feature space, by using a nonlinear mapping (φ) that does not need to be explicitly known but that depends of a kernel function. Then, the SVM algorithm finds the best linear separating hyperplane, tolerating a small error (ε) when fitting the data, in the feature space:	0	When designing a SVM, there are three crucial issues it should be taken into account: the type of SVM to use, the selection of the kernel function and tuning the parameters associated with the two previous selections.

CCT720	When applying these CI methods to TSF, variable and model selection are critical issues. A sliding time window is often used to create a set of training examples from the series. A small time window will provide insufficient information, while using a large number of time lags will increase the probability of having irrelevant inputs. Thus, variable selection is useful to discard irrelevant time lags, leading to simpler models that are easier to interpret and that usually give better performances [#CITATION_TAG,9,6]. On the other hand, CI models such as ANN and SVM have hyperparameters that need to be adjusted (e.g., number of ANN hidden nodes or kernel parameter) [8]. Complex models may overfit the data, losing the capability to generalize, while a model that is too simple will present limited learning capabilities.	2	When applying these CI methods to TSF, variable and model selection are critical issues.

CCT730	"A considerable treatment literature has been published on bulimia nervosa (BN) [1,2], which is marked by a chronic and relapse-ridden course, can result into serious medical complications, and is associated with severe comorbid psychopathology and functional impairment [3,4]. The bulk of this literature has focused on the use of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), which is widely considered as the treatment of choice for BN [1,2,5]. The theory [6] that underpins and guides CBT [7] is primarily concerned with the psychopathological processes that account for the persistence of the disorder. This theory assumes a dysfunctional system for evaluating self-worth [6], whereby self-worth is largely or even exclusively defined in terms of shape and weight and related control [8]. This over-evaluation of shape and weight (OSW) can then lead to dietary restraint, which often includes the adoption of rigid dietary rules about eating and food [6][7][8][9][10]. Due to the psychological and physiological effects of dietary restraint, when these inflexible dietary rules, which are extremely difficult to maintain, are broken, all attempts to control eating are abandoned and a binge occurs [6]. Although several randomised controlled trials have shown that CBT is more effective than a wide range of alternative treatments [1,2,5,11], amongst BN treatment completers, only 40-50 % have a full and lasting response [12]#CITATION_TAG[14]. The developers of the original CB theory argued that four additional factors might account for the persistence of dysfunctional cognitions (OSW) and eating-disordered behaviours in some patients that present obstacles for change: (a) interpersonal problems; (b) core low selfesteem; (c) clinical perfectionism; and (d) mood intolerance [12,13]. Accordingly, they reformulated the original CB theory into an enhanced version by encapsulating these factors that considered being ""trans-diagnostic"" as well [13]. According to the enhanced CB version (CB-E) [13], the difficulties in establishing and/or maintaining interpersonal relationships may directly precipitate episodes of binge eating, affect all of the other maintenance factors and/or amplify OSW [12,15]. The pervasive low self-esteem that often persists after recovery [16] is thought to lead to attempts to control shape and weight and similarly contribute to negative affect [13,17]. Despite adverse consequences, when clinical perfectionism or over-evaluation of striving for and achieving personally demanding standards [18] is present, it might encourage increased striving to achieve unrealistic high standards in the valued domain of shape and weight and foster dietary restraint [13,[18][19][20]. The final maintenance factor of mood intolerance (i.e. inability to appropriately cope with adverse affective states followed by dysfunctional impulsive behaviours) [13] is believed to directly affect and maintain binge eating [12,17,[21][22][23][24]. The CB-E approach is consistent with research that documented two subtypes of patients with BN and binge eating disorder (BED) based on purely dietary restraint (i.e. approximately 60-70 % of samples) versus dietarynegative affect (i.e. approximately 30-40 % of samples) dimensions [25,26]."	0	"This theory assumes a dysfunctional system for evaluating self-worth [6], whereby self-worth is largely or even exclusively defined in terms of shape and weight and related control [8].

CCT731	"The current study aimed at extending research in this area by testing and comparing the original and CB-E models in a large clinical sample seeking treatment for bulimic-type EDs, which include BN and its variants [bulimic-type ED not otherwise specified (EDNOS), i.e. EDs ""clinically significant but not meeting full DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for BN, or needing additional study, such as BED] [29]. It was expected that even though both theoretical models (Fig. 1) would provide a good fit to the observed data, the CB-E maintenance model would account for a greater proportion of the variance in dietary restraint and binge eating (i.e. the hallmark behaviour of all bulimic-type EDs) [13,29]. Evaluating whether the strength of the conceptual relationships of both CB maintenance models is similar or different across diagnostic groups and formally testing the significance of the mediation or indirect effects embedded within the CB models (Fig. 1) in each diagnostic group were additional aims of the study. It is worth of note that prior the completion of the study, the APA Task Force made several changes to ED diagnoses in the DSM-5 [30] in order to reduce the preponderance of the DSM-IV [31] Anorexic and bulimictype EDNOS category [29,32] that formed the most common ED among those seeking treatment [33]. Regarding bulimic-type EDNOS, in addition to making BED a formal diagnosis, DSM-5 [30] revised the behavioural criteria (i.e. the threshold for frequency and duration), eliminated the diagnostic subtypes for BN, and changed the EDNOS designation to Other Specified Feeding or ED; Online Resource 1 summarizes the diagnostic criteria for bulimic-type EDs from the fourth to the fifth editions. As a consequence, all cases initially diagnosed as BN and bulimic-type EDNOS using the DSM-IV [31] criteria were re-categorized using the new DSM-5 criteria [30]. All analyses conducted to evaluate our hypothesis (Fig. 1) and potential differences across groups were based on DSM-5 diagnosis of BN, BED, and bulimic-type EDNOS 1 ; for simplicity, this last term was used in the current manuscript to refer to bulimic-type diagnoses that fell into the Other Specified Feeding or ED group. Re-categorizing diagnoses also allowed us to evaluate the degree to which the use of DSM-5 criteria [30] decreased the proportion of DSM-IV [31] bulimic-type EDNOS cases. This is also a novel contribution to the current literature given that prior research using the same [34] or a similar [3,35] procedure focused on community samples rather than on clinical treatment seeking samples. 1 It is should be noted that, although both CB models posit that binge eating may encourage in some individuals compensatory behaviours aimed at counteracting the effects of binge eating on weight [6,13] for details, in the current manuscript we focused on binge eating and did not incorporate compensatory behaviours neither in the form of purging nor in the form of non-purging for three main reasons: (1) the scheme distinguishing purging and non-purging BN subtypes has been eliminated from DSM-5 (Online Resource 1); (2) the DSM-5 BN and BED diagnoses are distinguished by the presence versus absence of recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviours (Online Resource 1); and (3) the necessary prerequisite of the advanced statistical procedure (see ""Statistical Analyses"") used for evaluating if the strength of the conceptual relationships of both CB maintenance models (Fig. 1) is similar or different across DSM-5 BN, BED, and bulimic-type EDNOS (that includes also sub-threshold BED cases) is that the model under investigation should contain the same number of latent variables, each of which includes the same number of measured/observed variables for all groups of interest #CITATION_TAG."	0	"All analyses conducted to evaluate our hypothesis (Fig. 1) and potential differences across groups were based on DSM-5 diagnosis of BN, BED, and bulimic-type EDNOS 1 ; for simplicity, this last term was used in the current manuscript to refer to bulimic-type diagnoses that fell into the Other Specified Feeding or ED group.

CCT737	"After re-categorizing all DSM-IV cases using DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, differences in demographic and clinical variables between diagnostic groups were assessed by means of ANOVA or χ 2 test, as appropriate, followed by post hoc pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction if needed [46]. The appropriate measures of effect size for continuous (partial η 2 ) or categorical variables (Cramer"" s ϕ) were calculated. Cut-off conventions for partial η 2 are as follows: small (.01-.09), medium (.10-.24), and large (≥.25) [46]. Cut-off conventions for Cramer"" s ϕ (with df = 2) are as follows: small (.07-.20), medium (.21-.34), and large (≥.35) [46]. There were no missing data. Latent variable structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to examine both hypothesized CB models, depicted in Fig. 1. It involves estimation of (a) a measurement model and (b) a structural m o d e l w h i l e a c c o u n t i n g f o r m e a s u r e m e n t error [39]. The measurement model tests the proposed measurement of study constructs by estimating factor loadings between observed/measured variables and underlying latent variables (Online Resource 3), using confirmatory factor analysis. The structural model retains the components of the measurement model and tests the specified structural relationships between latent variables (i.e. the directional paths; Fig. 1); BMI and depression severity (i.e. BDI score) were covariates in each structural model and specified to predict each of the latent variables [39] in an attempt to reduce their effects on the relationships between the latent variables under investigation [17,#CITATION_TAG]. 5 EM analyses were performed in Mplus version 6.12 [49] with a maximum likelihood approach (as pre-analysis of the data did not reveal any evidence for univariate and multivariate non-normality). EM analyses were performed in Mplus version 6.12 [49] with a maximum likelihood approach (as pre-analysis of the data did not reveal any evidence for univariate and multivariate non-normality). Criteria for good measurement and structural model fit were as follows: Comparative Fit Index and Tucker-Lewis Index values ≥.95, standardized root-mean-square residual values ≤.08, and root-mean-square error of approximation values ≤.06 [39,49]. The Chi-square statistic (χ 2 ) is also reported. To obtain the most parsimonious and accurate representation of the data, we planned to trim non-significant structural paths and to add paths not originally specified (trimmed/revised model) but that impacted the fit of the model to the data based on the modification indices values (MIs > 5.0) provided by Mplus [39,49]; the trimmed/ revised models were re-examined for good fit, and the initial (hypothesized) and trimmed/revised (nested) models were compared using the Chi-square difference test (∆χ 2 ) [39]. Because the original and CB-E structural models were not nested models (i.e. hierarchically related to one other in the sense that their parameter sets are subsets of one another), it was not possible to use the ∆χ 2 to statistically compare model fit, and therefore, we compared the predictive utility of each CB model by examining the percentage of variance accounted for in dietary restraint and binge eating by each model, as recommended [24,39]."	0	Latent variable structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to examine both hypothesized CB models, depicted in Fig. 1.

The theory [6] that underpins and guides CBT [7] is primarily concerned with the psychopathological processes that account for the persistence of the disorder. This theory assumes a dysfunctional system for evaluating self-worth [6], whereby self-worth is largely or even exclusively defined in terms of shape and weight and related control [8]. This over-evaluation of shape and weight (OSW) can then lead to dietary restraint, which often includes the adoption of rigid dietary rules about eating and food [6][7][8][9][10]. Due to the psychological and physiological effects of dietary restraint, when these inflexible dietary rules, which are extremely difficult to maintain, are broken, all attempts to control eating are abandoned and a binge occurs [6]. Although several randomised controlled trials have shown that CBT is more effective than a wide range of alternative treatments [1,2,5,11], amongst BN treatment completers, only 40-50 % have a full and lasting response [12][13][14]. The developers of the original CB theory argued that four additional factors might account for the persistence of dysfunctional cognitions (OSW) and eating-disordered behaviours in some patients that present obstacles for change: (a) interpersonal problems; (b) core low selfesteem; (c) clinical perfectionism; and (d) mood intolerance [12,13]. Accordingly, they reformulated the original CB theory into an enhanced version by encapsulating these factors that considered being ""trans-diagnostic"" as well [13]. According to the enhanced CB version (CB-E) [13], the difficulties in establishing and/or maintaining interpersonal relationships may directly precipitate episodes of binge eating, affect all of the other maintenance factors and/or amplify OSW [12,15]. The pervasive low self-esteem that often persists after recovery [16] is thought to lead to attempts to control shape and weight and similarly contribute to negative affect [13,17]. Despite adverse consequences, when clinical perfectionism or over-evaluation of striving for and achieving personally demanding standards [18] is present, it might encourage increased striving to achieve unrealistic high standards in the valued domain of shape and weight and foster dietary restraint [13,[18][19][20]. The final maintenance factor of mood intolerance (i.e. inability to appropriately cope with adverse affective states followed by dysfunctional impulsive behaviours) [13] is believed to directly affect and maintain binge eating [12,17,[21][22][23][24]. The CB-E approach is consistent with research that documented two subtypes of patients with BN and binge eating disorder (BED) based on purely dietary restraint (i.e. approximately 60-70 % of samples) versus dietarynegative affect (i.e. approximately 30-40 % of samples) dimensions [25,26]."	0	A considerable treatment literature has been published on bulimia nervosa (BN) [1,#CITATION_TAG], which is marked by a chronic and relapse-ridden course, can result into serious medical complications, and is associated with severe comorbid psychopathology and functional impairment [3,4].

CCT742	"One of several changes to ED diagnoses that the APA Task Force made in DSM-5 [30] to decrease the preponderance of the EDNOS category [29,32] was the recognition of BED as a formal ED. When the DSM-5 criteria were applied to the current sample, the proportion of bulimictype EDNOS cases identified based on DSM-IV [31] criteria was reduced by 29.6 %; this reduction was due primarily to the reclassification of individuals into the BED diagnostic category. In sharp contrast to other ED diagnoses, the DSM-5 diagnosis of BED [30] does not include a criterion pertaining to body image, probably because of the belief that shape and weight concerns may simply reflect the (over)weight problems of BED patients #CITATION_TAG. However, research indicated that individuals with BED consistently described themselves as fatter than healthy controls matched for BMI, and their shape and weight concerns decrease as binge eating frequency decreases, even when BMI does not change [70]. The notion that body image concerns might be a clinical feature of BED is further supported by emerging research indicating that: (a) BED patients, as compared to normal-weight, overweight, and obese controls, have significantly greater shape and weight concerns, as well as greater eating-related psychopathology and psychological problems, including greater levels of depression and lower core self-esteem [71]; (b) greater body image concerns are predictors of poorer post-treatment outcomes, regardless of the specific type of treatment for BED [72], [70]; (c) BED patients report greater levels of shape and weight concerns than non-eating-disordered psychiatric controls [71]. The current study also provides evidence that shape and weight concerns are relevant in BED as in the other bulimic-type ED diagnostic groups (Table 2), as the differences across DSM-5 diagnostic groups, were minimal and not significant. 8 Based on the emerging empirical evidence summarized above and because the absence of a feature reflecting a disturbance in body image for the BED diagnosis casts this ED merely as a behavioural overeating construct, scholars have suggested the routine assessment of shape and weight concerns during clinical practice, as well as the incorporation of body image disturbance in the diagnostic scheme for BED in future DSM revisions, either as an individual criterion or as a diagnostic specifier (i.e. a sub-category within a diagnosis that assists with treatment matching and/or prediction of treatment outcome) [70,71]. Although much research is still needed, a similar change would be consistent with a """"trans-diagnostic"""" view of EDs [13], in which body image disturbance would be a core diagnostic feature of all EDs."	4	One of several changes to ED diagnoses that the APA Task Force made in DSM-5 [30] to decrease the preponderance of the EDNOS category [29,32] was the recognition of BED as a formal ED.

CCT743	Participants were drawn from a sample of 893 individuals consecutively referred to, and assessed for treatment of an ED, at five medium-large sized specialized care centres for EDs in Northern, Central, and Southern Italy between February 2011 and June 2013. Though a portion of this data set has already been used to evaluate the role of attachment in DSM-IV EDs [36], there is no overlap between those results and those presented here. In the current study, participants, who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for BN (n = 275) or bulimic-type EDNOS (n = 404), were included. Exclusion criteria comprised concurrent treatment for eating and weight-related disturbances, severe psychiatric conditions (psychosis) and intellectual disabilities, and insufficient knowledge of Italian. The flowchart of study participants is available in Online Resource 2. DSM-IV [31] ED and lifetime Axis I psychiatric disorder diagnoses were based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I/P) [37]. The ED diagnoses were confirmed by findings from the Eating Disorder Examination-Interview-12.0D (EDE) #CITATION_TAG, administered to assess dietary restraint and frequency of binge eating episodes as well (see measures section). At each participating centre, clinicians with experience and training in assessing and treating EDs carried out the diagnostic procedures. Approximately 22 % of the SCID-I/Ps and 20 % of the EDEs conducted were audio-recorded and rated by a blinded clinician to establish inter-rater reliability (κ), which was as follows: between .95 and 1.0 for lifetime and current (i.e. EDs) Axis I disorders; and 1.0 for diagnoses of EDs assessed by the means of EDE. All cases initially diagnosed as BN and bulimic-type EDNOS using the DSM-IV [31] criteria were re-categorized with the new DSM-5 criteria [30] on the basis of information from the interview records [34]. 2	0	Exclusion criteria comprised concurrent treatment for eating and weight-related disturbances, severe psychiatric conditions (psychosis) and intellectual disabilities, and insufficient knowledge of Italian.

CCT744	Apart from body image concerns, the preliminary evidence that all diagnostic groups report comparable scores in all measures used to assess the four maintaining factors (incorporated in the CB-E model) supports the suggestion that intrapersonal problems, core low self-esteem, clinical perfectionism, and mood intolerance are related to all bulimic-type EDs without differences at the diagnostic level [13,15,17,36]. On the other hand, differences between BED and the other bulimic-type ED diagnostic groups were also observed (Table 2). Prior research comparing individuals with provisional DSM-IV BED to either DSM-IV BN purging or non-purging subtypes found significant differences in both current (age, BMI, and dietary restraint at the time of the assessment) and age-historical variables (age of onset) #CITATION_TAG[74][75]. The same pattern was observed in this study using DSM-5 criteria, although the magnitude of the differences was less prominent, and the mean of some of the variables measured at the time of the assessment is higher (i.e. dietary restraint), or lower (i.e. BMI) that one might generally expect for the BED group [73]. Nevertheless, the variability of both current and agehistorical variables within BED population is well documented [73,74], and mean values of both dietary restraint and BMI for BED cases are quite close to those observed in other clinical studies [76,77], [73]. Since the mean age of our BED participants at the time of assessment is consistent with that reported in several Italian studies [76,78], but lower than that of American studies (ranging from 38 to 48 years) [73], the possibility that Italians with BED are less tolerant of their overweight condition [78,79] and thus seek treatment more often than their US counterparts should not be ruled out. However, future studies are needed to corroborate this hypothesis.	1	Apart from body image concerns, the preliminary evidence that all diagnostic groups report comparable scores in all measures used to assess the four maintaining factors (incorporated in the CB-E model) supports the suggestion that intrapersonal problems, core low self-esteem, clinical perfectionism, and mood intolerance are related to all bulimic-type EDs without differences at the diagnostic level [13,15,17,36].

CCT745	"While clinical perfectionism was the only maintaining variable directly linked to dietary restraint, interpersonal problems and mood intolerance were directly linked to binge eating, emphasizing the direct key role that both factors may have in its occurrence [11,21,22,44,48,52,53]. The positive and significant relationships between mood intolerance and binge eating are in accordance with CB-E model, which postulate that binge eating has a regulatory function and occur in an attempt to reduce the negative affective states [13]. However, in the current study, there was no direct relationship between dietary restraint and binge eating. This finding, as well as the evidence that interventions for binge eating that do not focus on reducing OSW and/or dietary restraint (i.e. interpersonal therapy, dialectical-behaviour therapy) decrease binge eating relative to assessment-only control conditions [1,2,11,54,55], seems incompatible with the theoretical assertion of both CB models, i.e. OSW affects binging indirectly through increasing the likelihood of dietary restraint [6,13]. Although there is evidence that initial dietary restraint levels predict future onset of binge eating among asymptomatic individuals [24,56,#CITATION_TAG], as in this study, prior research using clinical interviews or ecological momentary assessment failed to support the dietary restraint-binge eating relationship among bulimic-type ED patients [9,[58][59][60]. Although, the impact of dietary restraint on binge eating deserves further elucidation, the direct paths from interpersonal problems and mood intolerance to binge eating lend some credence to scholars"" suggestion that factors other than restraint may play a more critical role in the maintenance of binge eating among clinical samples [21,47,48,54,55], and highlight the importance of their inclusion in the CB-E theory, assessment, and target [12,13,21,23,28]. Moreover, the present study indicated that the dietary restraint-binge eating relationship is fully mediated and explained by mood intolerance. Although this indirect effect was unexpected, it appears consistent with findings from studies indicating that dietary manipulations that transiently deplete tryptophan levels (and consequently 5-HT synthesis in the brain) contribute to dysphoric mood in bulimic-type ED subjects [61,62], increasing the likelihood that an individual might binge eat to relieve dysphoria [21,22,48,60,61]. Furthermore, based on the results of neurobiological, molecular-genetic, and brain-imaging studies, Steiger and colleagues [63] postulated that factors affecting 5-HT functional activity may indirectly influence susceptibility to binge eating by heightening affective instability. Abnormal 5-HT status in subjects with bulimictype EDs may represents the cumulative effects of chronic dietary restraint [64][65][66], an inherited disposition, the consequence of exposure to intense developmental stressors, and traumatic experiences, and/or their combination [63]. Thus, a better understanding of the underlying serotonergic susceptibilities may explain heterogeneous clinical manifestations within the bulimic-type ED population and help clinicians to select the most appropriate treatment [63]. For instance, people with bulimic-type EDs whose variations in 5-HT status are mainly secondary consequences of dietary attempts may have relatively focal treatment needs (i.e. eating-symptom-focused therapies, such as the original version of CBT). However, different clinical pictures need to be considered. bulimic-type ED patients may benefit from more elaborate forms of interventions, such as the CBT-E [7,12,13,27], in case of more severe 5-HT abnormalities [63], and particularly if they are at least partly linked to affective instability mediated by 5-HT functioning or severe developmental disruptions that can affect both 5-HT functioning and affective instability [63]. Apart from the biological perceptive, cognitive factors may also play a central role in understanding the nature of the association between dietary restraint and binge eating. For instance, according to the abstinence violation effect (AVE) model, the inevitable violation of strict and inflexible dietary rules is thought to activate all-or-none thinking (e.g. perfect restraint vs. complete failure) [67]. This ""dichotomous"" thinking style, which is common among people who binge eat and addressed within CBT and CBT-E [7,13], is believed to heighten negative mood and disinhibit attempts to control what one eats [47,67]. Support for the AVE has been observed among binge-eaters [68,69]. Furthermore, longitudinal investigations amongst asymptomatic individuals revealed that the emotional distress caused by repeated perceived dietary failures increases mood deflection, which in turn results in increase binge eating [48,57]."	4	"The positive and significant relationships between mood intolerance and binge eating are in accordance with CB-E model, which postulate that binge eating has a regulatory function and occur in an attempt to reduce the negative affective states [13].

CCT746	"The current study aimed at extending research in this area by testing and comparing the original and CB-E models in a large clinical sample seeking treatment for bulimic-type EDs, which include BN and its variants [bulimic-type ED not otherwise specified (EDNOS), i.e. EDs ""clinically significant but not meeting full DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for BN, or needing additional study, such as BED] #CITATION_TAG. It was expected that even though both theoretical models (Fig. 1) would provide a good fit to the observed data, the CB-E maintenance model would account for a greater proportion of the variance in dietary restraint and binge eating (i.e. the hallmark behaviour of all bulimic-type EDs) [13,29]. Evaluating whether the strength of the conceptual relationships of both CB maintenance models is similar or different across diagnostic groups and formally testing the significance of the mediation or indirect effects embedded within the CB models (Fig. 1) in each diagnostic group were additional aims of the study. It is worth of note that prior the completion of the study, the APA Task Force made several changes to ED diagnoses in the DSM-5 [30] in order to reduce the preponderance of the DSM-IV [31] Anorexic and bulimictype EDNOS category [29,32] that formed the most common ED among those seeking treatment [33]. Regarding bulimic-type EDNOS, in addition to making BED a formal diagnosis, DSM-5 [30] revised the behavioural criteria (i.e. the threshold for frequency and duration), eliminated the diagnostic subtypes for BN, and changed the EDNOS designation to Other Specified Feeding or ED; Online Resource 1 summarizes the diagnostic criteria for bulimic-type EDs from the fourth to the fifth editions. As a consequence, all cases initially diagnosed as BN and bulimic-type EDNOS using the DSM-IV [31] criteria were re-categorized using the new DSM-5 criteria [30]. All analyses conducted to evaluate our hypothesis (Fig. 1) and potential differences across groups were based on DSM-5 diagnosis of BN, BED, and bulimic-type EDNOS 1 ; for simplicity, this last term was used in the current manuscript to refer to bulimic-type diagnoses that fell into the Other Specified Feeding or ED group. Re-categorizing diagnoses also allowed us to evaluate the degree to which the use of DSM-5 criteria [30] decreased the proportion of DSM-IV [31] bulimic-type EDNOS cases. This is also a novel contribution to the current literature given that prior research using the same [34] or a similar [3,35] procedure focused on community samples rather than on clinical treatment seeking samples. 1 It is should be noted that, although both CB models posit that binge eating may encourage in some individuals compensatory behaviours aimed at counteracting the effects of binge eating on weight [6,13] for details, in the current manuscript we focused on binge eating and did not incorporate compensatory behaviours neither in the form of purging nor in the form of non-purging for three main reasons: (1) the scheme distinguishing purging and non-purging BN subtypes has been eliminated from DSM-5 (Online Resource 1); (2) the DSM-5 BN and BED diagnoses are distinguished by the presence versus absence of recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviours (Online Resource 1); and (3) the necessary prerequisite of the advanced statistical procedure (see ""Statistical Analyses"") used for evaluating if the strength of the conceptual relationships of both CB maintenance models (Fig. 1) is similar or different across DSM-5 BN, BED, and bulimic-type EDNOS (that includes also sub-threshold BED cases) is that the model under investigation should contain the same number of latent variables, each of which includes the same number of measured/observed variables for all groups of interest [39]."	5	"The current study aimed at extending research in this area by testing and comparing the original and CB-E models in a large clinical sample seeking treatment for bulimic-type EDs, which include BN and its variants [bulimic-type ED not otherwise specified (EDNOS), i.e. EDs ""clinically significant but not meeting full DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for BN, or needing additional study, such as BED] #CITATION_TAG.

Support for the AVE has been observed among binge-eaters [68,69]. Furthermore, longitudinal investigations amongst asymptomatic individuals revealed that the emotional distress caused by repeated perceived dietary failures increases mood deflection, which in turn results in increase binge eating [48,57]."	3	"Although, the impact of dietary restraint on binge eating deserves further elucidation, the direct paths from interpersonal problems and mood intolerance to binge eating lend some credence to scholars"" suggestion that factors other than restraint may play a more critical role in the maintenance of binge eating among clinical samples [21,47,48,54,55], and highlight the importance of their inclusion in the CB-E theory, assessment, and target [12,13,21,23,28]. Moreover, the present study indicated that the dietary restraint-binge eating relationship is fully mediated and explained by mood intolerance. Although this indirect effect was unexpected, it appears consistent with findings from studies indicating that dietary manipulations that transiently deplete tryptophan levels (and consequently 5-HT synthesis in the brain) contribute to dysphoric mood in bulimic-type ED subjects [61,62], increasing the likelihood that an individual might binge eat to relieve dysphoria [21,22,48,60,61]. Furthermore, based on the results of neurobiological, molecular-genetic, and brain-imaging studies, Steiger and colleagues #CITATION_TAG postulated that factors affecting 5-HT functional activity may indirectly influence susceptibility to binge eating by heightening affective instability. Abnormal 5-HT status in subjects with bulimictype EDs may represents the cumulative effects of chronic dietary restraint [64][65][66], an inherited disposition, the consequence of exposure to intense developmental stressors, and traumatic experiences, and/or their combination [63]. Thus, a better understanding of the underlying serotonergic susceptibilities may explain heterogeneous clinical manifestations within the bulimic-type ED population and help clinicians to select the most appropriate treatment [63]. For instance, people with bulimic-type EDs whose variations in 5-HT status are mainly secondary consequences of dietary attempts may have relatively focal treatment needs (i.e. eating-symptom-focused therapies, such as the original version of CBT)."	o
CCT748	"A considerable treatment literature has been published on bulimia nervosa (BN) [#CITATION_TAG,2], which is marked by a chronic and relapse-ridden course, can result into serious medical complications, and is associated with severe comorbid psychopathology and functional impairment [3,4]. The bulk of this literature has focused on the use of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), which is widely considered as the treatment of choice for BN [1,2,5]. The theory [6] that underpins and guides CBT [7] is primarily concerned with the psychopathological processes that account for the persistence of the disorder. This theory assumes a dysfunctional system for evaluating self-worth [6], whereby self-worth is largely or even exclusively defined in terms of shape and weight and related control [8]. This over-evaluation of shape and weight (OSW) can then lead to dietary restraint, which often includes the adoption of rigid dietary rules about eating and food [6][7][8][9][10]. Due to the psychological and physiological effects of dietary restraint, when these inflexible dietary rules, which are extremely difficult to maintain, are broken, all attempts to control eating are abandoned and a binge occurs [6]. Although several randomised controlled trials have shown that CBT is more effective than a wide range of alternative treatments [1,2,5,11], amongst BN treatment completers, only 40-50 % have a full and lasting response [12][13][14]. The developers of the original CB theory argued that four additional factors might account for the persistence of dysfunctional cognitions (OSW) and eating-disordered behaviours in some patients that present obstacles for change: (a) interpersonal problems; (b) core low selfesteem; (c) clinical perfectionism; and (d) mood intolerance [12,13]. Accordingly, they reformulated the original CB theory into an enhanced version by encapsulating these factors that considered being ""trans-diagnostic"" as well [13]. According to the enhanced CB version (CB-E) [13], the difficulties in establishing and/or maintaining interpersonal relationships may directly precipitate episodes of binge eating, affect all of the other maintenance factors and/or amplify OSW [12,15]. The pervasive low self-esteem that often persists after recovery [16] is thought to lead to attempts to control shape and weight and similarly contribute to negative affect [13,17]. Despite adverse consequences, when clinical perfectionism or over-evaluation of striving for and achieving personally demanding standards [18] is present, it might encourage increased striving to achieve unrealistic high standards in the valued domain of shape and weight and foster dietary restraint [13,[18][19][20]. The final maintenance factor of mood intolerance (i.e. inability to appropriately cope with adverse affective states followed by dysfunctional impulsive behaviours) [13] is believed to directly affect and maintain binge eating [12,17,[21][22][23][24]. The CB-E approach is consistent with research that documented two subtypes of patients with BN and binge eating disorder (BED) based on purely dietary restraint (i.e. approximately 60-70 % of samples) versus dietarynegative affect (i.e. approximately 30-40 % of samples) dimensions [25,26]."	4	A considerable treatment literature has been published on bulimia nervosa (BN) [#CITATION_TAG,2], which is marked by a chronic and relapse-ridden course, can result into serious medical complications, and is associated with severe comorbid psychopathology and functional impairment [3,4].

Measurement and structural invariance is supported if the strength of the factor loadings and the path estimates is equivalent across groups, respectively. To test for invariance, constrained (i.e. measurement or structural parameters were fixed to be equal for the groups) and unconstrained (i.e. parameters were allowed to vary; nested) models were compared using the ∆χ 2 [39]; a non-significant ∆χ 2 indicates that model parameters are invariant across DSM-5 diagnostic groups.

CCT755	"After re-categorizing all DSM-IV cases using DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, differences in demographic and clinical variables between diagnostic groups were assessed by means of ANOVA or χ 2 test, as appropriate, followed by post hoc pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction if needed #CITATION_TAG. The appropriate measures of effect size for continuous (partial η 2 ) or categorical variables (Cramer"" s ϕ) were calculated. Cut-off conventions for partial η 2 are as follows: small (.01-.09), medium (.10-.24), and large (≥.25) [46]. Cut-off conventions for Cramer"" s ϕ (with df = 2) are as follows: small (.07-.20), medium (.21-.34), and large (≥.35) [46]. There were no missing data. Latent variable structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to examine both hypothesized CB models, depicted in Fig. 1. It involves estimation of (a) a measurement model and (b) a structural m o d e l w h i l e a c c o u n t i n g f o r m e a s u r e m e n t error [39]. The measurement model tests the proposed measurement of study constructs by estimating factor loadings between observed/measured variables and underlying latent variables (Online Resource 3), using confirmatory factor analysis. The structural model retains the components of the measurement model and tests the specified structural relationships between latent variables (i.e. the directional paths; Fig. 1); BMI and depression severity (i.e. BDI score) were covariates in each structural model and specified to predict each of the latent variables [39] in an attempt to reduce their effects on the relationships between the latent variables under investigation [17,48]. 5 EM analyses were performed in Mplus version 6.12 [49] with a maximum likelihood approach (as pre-analysis of the data did not reveal any evidence for univariate and multivariate non-normality). Criteria for good measurement and structural model fit were as follows: Comparative Fit Index and Tucker-Lewis Index values ≥.95, standardized root-mean-square residual values ≤.08, and root-mean-square error of approximation values ≤.06 [39,49]. The Chi-square statistic (χ 2 ) is also reported. To obtain the most parsimonious and accurate representation of the data, we planned to trim non-significant structural paths and to add paths not originally specified (trimmed/revised model) but that impacted the fit of the model to the data based on the modification indices values (MIs > 5.0) provided by Mplus [39,49]; the trimmed/ revised models were re-examined for good fit, and the initial (hypothesized) and trimmed/revised (nested) models were compared using the Chi-square difference test (∆χ 2 ) [39]. Because the original and CB-E structural models were not nested models (i.e. hierarchically related to one other in the sense that their parameter sets are subsets of one another), it was not possible to use the ∆χ 2 to statistically compare model fit, and therefore, we compared the predictive utility of each CB model by examining the percentage of variance accounted for in dietary restraint and binge eating by each model, as recommended [24,39]."	0	"After re-categorizing all DSM-IV cases using DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, differences in demographic and clinical variables between diagnostic groups were assessed by means of ANOVA or χ 2 test, as appropriate, followed by post hoc pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction if needed #CITATION_TAG.

CCT756	"The current study aimed at extending research in this area by testing and comparing the original and CB-E models in a large clinical sample seeking treatment for bulimic-type EDs, which include BN and its variants [bulimic-type ED not otherwise specified (EDNOS), i.e. EDs ""clinically significant but not meeting full DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for BN, or needing additional study, such as BED] [29]. It was expected that even though both theoretical models (Fig. 1) would provide a good fit to the observed data, the CB-E maintenance model would account for a greater proportion of the variance in dietary restraint and binge eating (i.e. the hallmark behaviour of all bulimic-type EDs) [13,29]. Evaluating whether the strength of the conceptual relationships of both CB maintenance models is similar or different across diagnostic groups and formally testing the significance of the mediation or indirect effects embedded within the CB models (Fig. 1) in each diagnostic group were additional aims of the study. It is worth of note that prior the completion of the study, the APA Task Force made several changes to ED diagnoses in the DSM-5 [30] in order to reduce the preponderance of the DSM-IV [31] Anorexic and bulimictype EDNOS category [29,32] that formed the most common ED among those seeking treatment [33]. Regarding bulimic-type EDNOS, in addition to making BED a formal diagnosis, DSM-5 [30] revised the behavioural criteria (i.e. the threshold for frequency and duration), eliminated the diagnostic subtypes for BN, and changed the EDNOS designation to Other Specified Feeding or ED; Online Resource 1 summarizes the diagnostic criteria for bulimic-type EDs from the fourth to the fifth editions. As a consequence, all cases initially diagnosed as BN and bulimic-type EDNOS using the DSM-IV [31] criteria were re-categorized using the new DSM-5 criteria [30]. All analyses conducted to evaluate our hypothesis (Fig. 1) and potential differences across groups were based on DSM-5 diagnosis of BN, BED, and bulimic-type EDNOS 1 ; for simplicity, this last term was used in the current manuscript to refer to bulimic-type diagnoses that fell into the Other Specified Feeding or ED group. Re-categorizing diagnoses also allowed us to evaluate the degree to which the use of DSM-5 criteria [30] decreased the proportion of DSM-IV [31] bulimic-type EDNOS cases. This is also a novel contribution to the current literature given that prior research using the same [34] or a similar [3,35] procedure focused on community samples rather than on clinical treatment seeking samples. 1 This is also a novel contribution to the current literature given that prior research using the same #CITATION_TAG or a similar [3,35] procedure focused on community samples rather than on clinical treatment seeking samples. 1 It is should be noted that, although both CB models posit that binge eating may encourage in some individuals compensatory behaviours aimed at counteracting the effects of binge eating on weight [6,13] for details, in the current manuscript we focused on binge eating and did not incorporate compensatory behaviours neither in the form of purging nor in the form of non-purging for three main reasons: (1) the scheme distinguishing purging and non-purging BN subtypes has been eliminated from DSM-5 (Online Resource 1); (2) the DSM-5 BN and BED diagnoses are distinguished by the presence versus absence of recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviours (Online Resource 1); and (3) the necessary prerequisite of the advanced statistical procedure (see ""Statistical Analyses"") used for evaluating if the strength of the conceptual relationships of both CB maintenance models (Fig. 1) is similar or different across DSM-5 BN, BED, and bulimic-type EDNOS (that includes also sub-threshold BED cases) is that the model under investigation should contain the same number of latent variables, each of which includes the same number of measured/observed variables for all groups of interest [39]."	0	"All analyses conducted to evaluate our hypothesis (Fig. 1) and potential differences across groups were based on DSM-5 diagnosis of BN, BED, and bulimic-type EDNOS 1 ; for simplicity, this last term was used in the current manuscript to refer to bulimic-type diagnoses that fell into the Other Specified Feeding or ED group.

CCT757	Participants were drawn from a sample of 893 individuals consecutively referred to, and assessed for treatment of an ED, at five medium-large sized specialized care centres for EDs in Northern, Central, and Southern Italy between February 2011 and June 2013. Though a portion of this data set has already been used to evaluate the role of attachment in DSM-IV EDs [36], there is no overlap between those results and those presented here. In the current study, participants, who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for BN (n = 275) or bulimic-type EDNOS (n = 404), were included. Exclusion criteria comprised concurrent treatment for eating and weight-related disturbances, severe psychiatric conditions (psychosis) and intellectual disabilities, and insufficient knowledge of Italian. The flowchart of study participants is available in Online Resource 2. DSM-IV [31] ED and lifetime Axis I psychiatric disorder diagnoses were based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I/P) #CITATION_TAG. The ED diagnoses were confirmed by findings from the Eating Disorder Examination-Interview-12.0D (EDE) [38], administered to assess dietary restraint and frequency of binge eating episodes as well (see measures section). At each participating centre, clinicians with experience and training in assessing and treating EDs carried out the diagnostic procedures. Approximately 22 % of the SCID-I/Ps and 20 % of the EDEs conducted were audio-recorded and rated by a blinded clinician to establish inter-rater reliability (κ), which was as follows: between .95 and 1.0 for lifetime and current (i.e. EDs) Axis I disorders; and 1.0 for diagnoses of EDs assessed by the means of EDE.

CCT758	"While clinical perfectionism was the only maintaining variable directly linked to dietary restraint, interpersonal problems and mood intolerance were directly linked to binge eating, emphasizing the direct key role that both factors may have in its occurrence [11,21,22,44,48,52,53]. The positive and significant relationships between mood intolerance and binge eating are in accordance with CB-E model, which postulate that binge eating has a regulatory function and occur in an attempt to reduce the negative affective states [13]. However, in the current study, there was no direct relationship between dietary restraint and binge eating. This finding, as well as the evidence that interventions for binge eating that do not focus on reducing OSW and/or dietary restraint (i.e. interpersonal therapy, dialectical-behaviour therapy) decrease binge eating relative to assessment-only control conditions [1,2,11,54,#CITATION_TAG], seems incompatible with the theoretical assertion of both CB models, i.e. OSW affects binging indirectly through increasing the likelihood of dietary restraint [6,13]. Although there is evidence that initial dietary restraint levels predict future onset of binge eating among asymptomatic individuals [24,56,57], as in this study, prior research using clinical interviews or ecological momentary assessment failed to support the dietary restraint-binge eating relationship among bulimic-type ED patients [9,[58][59][60]. Although, the impact of dietary restraint on binge eating deserves further elucidation, the direct paths from interpersonal problems and mood intolerance to binge eating lend some credence to scholars"" suggestion that factors other than restraint may play a more critical role in the maintenance of binge eating among clinical samples [21,47,48,54,55], and highlight the importance of their inclusion in the CB-E theory, assessment, and target [12,13,21,23,28]. Moreover, the present study indicated that the dietary restraint-binge eating relationship is fully mediated and explained by mood intolerance. Although this indirect effect was unexpected, it appears consistent with findings from studies indicating that dietary manipulations that transiently deplete tryptophan levels (and consequently 5-HT synthesis in the brain) contribute to dysphoric mood in bulimic-type ED subjects [61,62], increasing the likelihood that an individual might binge eat to relieve dysphoria [21,22,48,60,61]. Furthermore, based on the results of neurobiological, molecular-genetic, and brain-imaging studies, Steiger and colleagues [63] postulated that factors affecting 5-HT functional activity may indirectly influence susceptibility to binge eating by heightening affective instability. Abnormal 5-HT status in subjects with bulimictype EDs may represents the cumulative effects of chronic dietary restraint [64][65][66], an inherited disposition, the consequence of exposure to intense developmental stressors, and traumatic experiences, and/or their combination [63]. Thus, a better understanding of the underlying serotonergic susceptibilities may explain heterogeneous clinical manifestations within the bulimic-type ED population and help clinicians to select the most appropriate treatment [63]. For instance, people with bulimic-type EDs whose variations in 5-HT status are mainly secondary consequences of dietary attempts may have relatively focal treatment needs (i.e. eating-symptom-focused therapies, such as the original version of CBT). However, different clinical pictures need to be considered. bulimic-type ED patients may benefit from more elaborate forms of interventions, such as the CBT-E [7,12,13,27], in case of more severe 5-HT abnormalities [63], and particularly if they are at least partly linked to affective instability mediated by 5-HT functioning or severe developmental disruptions that can affect both 5-HT functioning and affective instability [63]. Apart from the biological perceptive, cognitive factors may also play a central role in understanding the nature of the association between dietary restraint and binge eating. For instance, according to the abstinence violation effect (AVE) model, the inevitable violation of strict and inflexible dietary rules is thought to activate all-or-none thinking (e.g. perfect restraint vs. complete failure) [67]. This ""dichotomous"" thinking style, which is common among people who binge eat and addressed within CBT and CBT-E [7,13], is believed to heighten negative mood and disinhibit attempts to control what one eats [47,67]. Support for the AVE has been observed among binge-eaters [68,69]. Furthermore, longitudinal investigations amongst asymptomatic individuals revealed that the emotional distress caused by repeated perceived dietary failures increases mood deflection, which in turn results in increase binge eating [48,57]."	1	"While clinical perfectionism was the only maintaining variable directly linked to dietary restraint, interpersonal problems and mood intolerance were directly linked to binge eating, emphasizing the direct key role that both factors may have in its occurrence [11,21,22,44,48,52,53].

CCT770	"In principle, shifting this risk away from the originating institution and its debtor makes sense because there are other market participants who are better able to bear this risk. Some market participants actually have long investment horizons and therefore do not consider the interest risk of real-estate finance to be a risk at all. Thus, an insurance company or a pension fund has liabilities with maturities of twenty years or more, not too far removed from the economic life of a real-estate investment or the maturity of a mortgage instrument. If such an institution invests in a long-term fixed-rate instrument, i.e., a mortgage or a mortgage-backed security, the question of how the market values this instrument at intervening dates is irrelevant because there is no point in liquidating this investment anyway and the institution""s ability to fulfil its obligation to its own financiers depends on the returns from the security rather than the market""s assessment. Indeed, for an insurance company or pension fund, a fall in the value of long-term securities that is induced by an increase in interest rates tends to be unproblematic. The very increase in interest rates provides the institution with scope to earn higher returns on new investments and thereby to better fulfil its obligations to its insurance and pension customers. 16 ven if one cannot a priori distinguish between short-term and long-term investors, the securitization of long-term investments can still make economic sense. Thus, in the context of a model in which investors do not know beforehand when they will want to consume, #CITATION_TAG (1994a) shows that it is optimal to have an arrangement where people stipulate the amounts of short-term and long-term assets that they want to hold, with the proviso that, if they find that they want to consume early, they should bear the interest-induced valuation risk of long-term investments, and, if they want to consume late, they should bear the interest-induced reinvestment risk of short-term investments. All risks that are associated with changes in interest rates should thus be shifted to final investors. Securitization provides one way to achieve this."	5	Indeed, for an insurance company or pension fund, a fall in the value of long-term securities that is induced by an increase in interest rates tends to be unproblematic.

CCT774	"As mentioned in the introduction, the IMF estimates that the total volume of non-prime mortgage-backed securities in the United States amounts to some 1.1 trillion dollars. 72 In absolute terms, this is a large number. However, this number amounts to less than one fifth of the value of all residential mortgage-backed securities in the United States (5.6 trillion dollars), less than one tenth of the value of all residential mortgages in the United States (13 trillion dollars), less than one twentieth of the value of residential real estate in the United States (20-30 trillion dollars), and presumably less than one fortieth of the value of total private wealth in the United States. 73 ore to the point, the estimated 500 billion dollars of losses in non-prime mortgage-backed securities are much smaller than stock market losses after the burst of the technology bubble in 2000; 74 they are also smaller than the 71 International Monetary Fund (2007, p. 7).

CCT779	"At this point, I come back to the discussion of biases in bank governance in Section 3.6 above. As discussed there, discourse inside the banks and in relations between the banks and the representatives of ""market discipline"" seems to have focussed on yield, without questioning the implications for the institution\""s exposure to risk. The ability to control risk through model-based risk management was taken for granted, to be handled as a matter of routine. In the case of the Swiss bank UBS, this attitude provided the investment banking branch with the means to prevent any comprehensive risk assessment of their activities by Senior Group Management until the summer of 2007. The very same attitude seems to have been responsible for the extent to which such institutions were ""economizing"" on equity. 107 The very same attitude seems to have been responsible for the extent to which such institutions were ""economizing"" on equity. 107 bove, I have suggested that the focus on yield at the expense of risk may be reinforced by governance mechanisms that rely on ""market discipline"" in the name of ""shareholder value and that the ease of measuring returns and of communicating about returns as opposed to measuring risks and communicating about risks introduces a bias in favour of strategies that involve 106 The classic reference on this point is #CITATION_TAG (1975). 107 For UBS and Crédit Suisse, the Financial Stability Department of the Swiss National Bank has raised concerns about the insufficiency of equity capital since at least 2001 and had put forward proposals to supplement existing capital regulation by a leverage ratio which would install an overall floor for the equity ratio; see Bichsel and Blum (2001, 2005), Blum (2008. Prior to the crisis, these proposals met with the response that the size of the balance sheet was not a good indicator of risk because, for many assets and liabilities, returns and obligations were so highly correlated that the net impact of these positions on the risk of the bank was negligible and hardly any equity was needed to cushion this risk.

CCT788	"For a long time, moral hazard in origination seems to have been reasonably contained. The creation of mortgage-backed securities was almost entirely in the hands of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation are commonly called. These government-sponsored enterprises 28 provided the buyers of mortgage-backed securities with a guarantee for the promised debt service; at the same time, they imposed certain minimum standards on mortgage debtors, namely, high credit scores reflecting large down payments, low ratios of debt service to documented available income, and reliable credit histories of mortgage borrowers. For mortgages that met these standards, socalled ""prime mortgages delinquency rates and default rates were -and still are -very low. 29 annie Mae and Freddie Mac had in fact played a key role in the development of the markets for mortgage-backed securities. When they began to buy mortgages, to package them, and to sell the mortgage-backed securities in the open market, the mortgage-backed securities were acceptable to investors because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also provided guarantees for the promised payments from these securities. The origins of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as government institutions led many investors to believe that, even though these institutions had been privatized, their guarantees had some kind of backing from the government 30 and could therefore be deemed to be reliable. 31 owever, in the years since 2000, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been challenged by competition from other financial institutions, in particular, private investment banks, which did not guarantee their issues of mortgagebacked securities in the same way as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The share of the government-sponsored enterprises in the issuance of mortgage-backed securities went from 76% in 2003 to 43% in 2006. 32 At the same time, there was a relative decline in prime mortgage lending and a significant increase in subprime mortgage lending, i.e., in the issuance of mortgages that did not 29 The difficulties that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have had in the crisis had more to do with their being pressured by the political system to provide support for subprime mortgagebacked securities in 2007 than with problems in the prime mortgages that had been their main business. However, one suspects that the expansion in prime mortgage lending between 1995 and 2003 may have been accompanied by a decline in borrower quality. This would be the analogue for prime mortgages of findings of #CITATION_TAG and Van Hemert (2008) showing that, since 2001, in subprime mortgage lending, there have been declines in borrower quality that go beyond the effects of changes in observables such as down payment rates, credit scores and the like. 30 Since the privatization of these institutions in the late sixties, this belief would not have had any basis in the law. Even so, the developments since July 2008 have shown that this belief was justified. The position of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the system of housing finance in the United States is too important for the government to look aside when these institutions run into trouble. 31 Thus, at the time when the system of mortgage-backed securities was developed, the neglect of moral hazard induced by securitization was at least partly due to a reliance of market participants on government guarantees. 32 See Dodd (2007). The challenge in the market was preceded by political discussions about these institutions"" roles including accusations by the US Government of errors in dealing with new accounting rules for derivatives. These discussions induced the government-sponsored enterprises to retrench their activities in the market. meet the standards of the government-sponsored enterprises. The share of subprime mortgages rose from around 9% of new mortgages in the early 2000""s to above 40% in 2006. 33 By the end of 2006, subprime mortgages accounted for some 14% of the total stock of outstanding securitized mortgages (7% in 2001). 34 hese changes have caused the quality of mortgages to go down. According to the International Monetary Fund (2007), the share of the stock of securitized mortgages in which the loan accounted for more than 90% of the property value went from about 5% in 2001 to 14% in 2006; the share of securitized mortgages with limited documentation of income went from 7% in 2001 to 18% in 2006. These changes in mortgage quality are linked to the rise of nonprime lending: Average down payments in near prime mortgages, the so-called Alt-A mortgages, and in subprime mortgages were 12% and 6%, respectively, substantially below down payments in prime mortgages; in many instances, there was no down payment at all. In 2006, there was less than full documentation of income in 81% of Alt-A and 50% of subprime mortgages, as opposed to 36% of prime mortgages. 35 hese years also saw the resurrection of adjustable-rate mortgages. Their share of the stock of outstanding mortgages went from 6% in 2001 to 26% in 2006. 36 In 2006 indeed, 92% of newly issued subprime mortgages, 68% of newly issued Alt-A mortgages, and 23% of newly issued prime mortgages had adjustable rates. 37 The lesson of the eighties, that adjustable rates cause credit risk to be higher, seems to have been lost -perhaps forgotten, perhaps also neglected because, after all, the credit risk would affect the holders of mortgage-backed securities rather than the originators of the mortgages."	0	The share of the government-sponsored enterprises in the issuance of mortgage-backed securities went from 76% in 2003 to 43% in 2006. 32 At the same time, there was a relative decline in prime mortgage lending and a significant increase in subprime mortgage lending, i.e., in the issuance of mortgages that did not 29 The difficulties that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have had in the crisis had more to do with their being pressured by the political system to provide support for subprime mortgagebacked securities in 2007 than with problems in the prime mortgages that had been their main business.

CCT789	"-Equity capital affects incentives for risk taking. 116 -Capital regulation provides room for intervention by the supervisor at a time when the bank is not yet subjected to insolvency proceedings. 117 e might consider that the difference does not matter if, in fact, capital regulation can serve all three purposes. However, the rule for determining required capital will depend on which of the three purposes one is thinking of. If one is thinking of equity capital as a buffer against insolvency risk, one is concerned about the total risk to which the institution is subjected. The risk weights of different assets should then be tied to the total contribution that each asset makes to the institution""s risk. If one is thinking of equity capital as an incentive device, one must be concerned about incentive effects at the margin and attune the risk weights of different assets to the marginal impact of increases in the different asset positions on the institution""s risk.

In this case, it seems more important to make sure that the intervention threshold cannot be manipulated and to have a plan for how to intervene when the threshold is reached.

Otherwise, Irina is newly introduced (see also #CITATION_TAG and van de Koot 2008), and as such it obligatorily receives a structural accent, which leads to an intervention effect with the fronted focused object. 34 Recall that multiple wh-contexts where both elements are not contextually given do not allow inversion. The elements receive structural accents and undergo immediate linearization (cf. examples ( 30)-(31) in Sect. 3.2). 35 Examples ( 14) and ( 16) in Sect. 3 represent a slightly different case, the crossed elements being functional elements that do not receive structural accents. We conclude that the necessary condition for the possibility of accent crossing is that the two participating elements are not both structurally accented. In rise-fall constructions, crossing is limited to contexts rendering one of the participants contextually given (or to contexts with one of the participants being a functional expression), which results in constellations where only one of the participants receives a structural accent. It is not important whether the fronted categories are contrastive topics or foci or their parts, as long as this condition is fulfilled. Accentuation of given elements is further subject to interface conditions: contrastive topics and foci ultimately have to receive an accent, accent marking of topics is optional. 36	1	On the other hand, elements with a structural accent may cross an element that is accented but given.

CCT795	( The present paper argues that this view is misguided. Accentuation rather than informational status determines which categories can be fronted, but this special role of accentuation does not imply that syntax refers to prosodic features. Accentuation comes into play indirectly only, its relevance for fronting stems from the fact that accentuation is a side-effect of cyclic linearization in the sense of #CITATION_TAG and Pesetsky (2005) and Müller (2007). In addition to offering a new analysis of Czech and German constituent order, our paper therefore also addresses broader theoretical issues.

CCT797	"Finally, the analysis of LP-movement in terms of information structure features turns out to be empirically inadequate. Topics and foci are fronted in only a subset of the LP-movement contexts. When neither the focus nor the topic moves to first position (because their left peripheral placement is optional), some elements may go there in the absence of any discourse motivation. This holds, for instance, for sentential adverbs, as in (7), and for subjects, as in (8). The movement of these elements cannot serve the checking of topic/focus features. The import of such examples was first noted by Travis (1984), who argued for a TP-analysis of (8). Van Craenenbroek and Haegeman (2007) show, however, that subject-initial verb second clauses cannot be analysed as TPs. Based on a suggestion of H. Haider, Fanselow (2002) and #CITATION_TAG (2005) argue that (7-8) illustrate the same phenomenon: any category that can appear leftmost in TP can move to SpecCP without possessing any special discourse marking. 7 We follow Frey (2005) in calling this movement ""formal fronting"" (FF), but the label is just a shorthand for a particular constellation arising from the application of LP-movement, and not a name for a separate syntactic process.

CCT799	For several reasons, however, LP-movement cannot be successfully captured in terms of information structure driven movement. First, such accounts seem problematic from a minimalist point of view.

CCT801	Along with hypochlorhydria (that can predispose the elderly to small intestine overgrowth, Fe malabsorption, and vitamin B12 deficiency), evidence suggests that reduction in gastric compliance, particularly of the fundus, plays an important role in the anorexia of ageing and satiety response. 2 The loss of neurons in both submucosal, gastric and enteric plexus begins early in life, along with a reduction in the expression of acetylcholine (ACh) and nitric oxide (NO). 1,2 Furthermore, orexigenic factors like neuropeptide Y decline with ageing, and leptin (a hormone related to satiety) have been shown to increase, particularly in men, probably due to a decrease in testosterone. 2 he increase in colonic transit time and decline in propulsive activity are hypothesized to be related to neurodegeneration and reduction in NO and ACh, making the elderly prone to constipation. 2 The colon plays little role in nutrition, but is an important element for gut microbiome; the number of colony-forming units (CFU) increases from 10 2 CFU in the upper small bowel to 10 12 CFU in the colon. 2 s the authors stated, 1 the gut microbiota plays an important role in the maintenance of the host health and disease in all age groups, but particularly in the elderly. 3 The mechanisms related to the benefits of probiotics are incompletely understood. However, four general benefits have been described: (1) suppression of growth or epithelial binding/invasion by pathogenic bacteria, (2) improvement of intestinal barrier function, (3) modulation of the immune system, and (4) modulation of pain perception. 1,3,4 he majority of bacteria in the colon are anaerobes that can ferment carbohydrates that escape digestion, to form short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and anions that have a distinct role in promoting gut health (e.g., acetate, propionate, and butyrate). 3 Studies in the elderly described a shift in the composition of intestinal microbiota, with a lower number of beneficial organisms such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli 1 and an increase in Enterobacteriaceae and certain Proteobacteria. 3 Compared to younger adult controls, aged persons seem to have a lower number of Firmicutes and more abundant Bacteroidetes. 3 Butyrate is the major energy source for the colonic epithelium, and its levels are usually lower in the elderly, with concomitant increased levels of SCFAs, ammonia, and phenols. 3 Evidence showed that lactate accumulation in the colon might be indicative of gut microbiome imbalance, and it was suggested that this could be a target for the development of novel probiotics to prevent lactate accumulation. 3 espite previous good to moderate evidence of the beneficial effects of probiotic and synbiotic administration, recent larger randomized controlled trials reported contradictory results related to the reduction in the risk of infections [Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), upper respiratory tract infections, antibiotic-associated-diarrhea (AAD), etc.]. The PLACIDE Trial reported no evidence of a multi strain preparation of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the prevention of AAD and CDAD. 4 nother recent large trial evaluated the evidence of the preventive effect of probiotics on upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) in an aged sample, and was unable to find differences between groups. #CITATION_TAG Only in the subgroup analysis did the authors find that probiotics probably reduced the duration of acute URTI. 5 espite good evidence of the clinical benefit of probiotic use in children and under some specific conditions, there are no metaanalysis and systematic reviews, to date, that address the use of probiotics in the elderly for infection prevention and control. This issue, we hope, will soon be covered by a systematic review protocol that we are already developing.	1	3 espite previous good to moderate evidence of the beneficial effects of probiotic and synbiotic administration, recent larger randomized controlled trials reported contradictory results related to the reduction in the risk of infections [Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), upper respiratory tract infections, antibiotic-associated-diarrhea (AAD), etc.].

CCT807	Research in perceptual learning has long shown that intermixed presentations result in improved ability to discriminate stimuli when compared to blocking different stimuli separately. For instance, using coloured checkerboards  demonstrated that preexposing stimuli intermixed resulted in improved discrimination accuracy in a same/ different task, when compared to blocked preexposure. #CITATION_TAG, Honey, and Dwyer (2007) obtained analogous results using morphed pictures of human faces. Moreover, these authors included a nonpreexposure group that resulted in worse performance than both the groups with blocked and intermixed preexposure (for similar results using checkerboards see Mundy, Honey, & Dwyer, 2009). One simple explanation for this advantage might be that intermixing directs attention to the relevant features of the stimuli. Indeed, in her influential theory of perceptual learning, Eleanor Gibson (1969) proposed that preexposure enhances discrimination through a process of differentiation. This mechanism involved the abstraction of the relevant features of the stimuli and filtering, or ignoring, the irrelevant features. Moreover, the process would be enhanced by situations that allowed for greater opportunity for comparison, as the intermixed schedule of presentation.	0	Research in perceptual learning has long shown that intermixed presentations result in improved ability to discriminate stimuli when compared to blocking different stimuli separately.

CCT825	Partly in an attempt to overcome this problem, and partly in recognition of the fact that it is likely that not all values of sensitivity or specificity will be regarded as relevant, various researchers have proposed the use of the partial AUC, PAUC, in which the integration in (3) is not over the entire range of sensitivity (or specificity), but over some interval [ ] , a b within [ ] 0,1 , regarded as of particular relevance (see, for example, #CITATION_TAG). Of course, this requires the user to specify a and b, which means that the non-subjective merit of the AUC is lost. In any case, it is entirely possible that the interval [ ] , a b will include a point where the ROC curves cross. Furthermore, the PAUC has the unfortunate implication that values of sensitivity just outside the interval are discounted, whereas those just inside are included. An alternative solution would be to choose a smooth non-uniform distribution with support [ ] 0,1 .	1	Partly in an attempt to overcome this problem, and partly in recognition of the fact that it is likely that not all values of sensitivity or specificity will be regarded as relevant, various researchers have proposed the use of the partial AUC, PAUC, in which the integration in (3) is not over the entire range of sensitivity (or specificity), but over some interval [ ] , a b within [ ] 0,1 , regarded as of particular relevance (see, for example, #CITATION_TAG).

We therefore suggested that, instead of picking a particular balance, one should take an expectation of the minimum weighted misclassification loss over a distribution of values of the weights defining the balance. This is analogous to the AUC, which is an average of specificity over a uniform distribution of sensitivity, except that we take the expectation over the severity balance between the two kinds of misdiagnosis, instead of over sensitivity. We then showed that the AUC itself could be expressed as an expectation over the minimum balanced misclassification loss.

As such, fsQCA is a proficient tool that helps supplement traditional correlational analyses in three main ways: (1) asymmetry (i.e., the relationships between independent and dependent variables are treated as not symmetric), ( 2) equifinality (i.e., multiple pathways and solutions lead to the same outcome), and (3) causal complexity (i.e., combinations of causal antecedent conditions lead to the outcome, and thus the researcher focuses not on the estimation of independent net effects but on the estimation of combinatorial effects) (#CITATION_TAG, 2013).	0	Applications of the technique in business and management are fewer, though representative examples are available in areas such as international business (e.g., Pajunen, 2008;Schneider et al., 2010), innovation (e.g., Cheng et al., 2013;Ganter & Hecker, 2013;Stanko & Olleros, 2013), organizational behavior and strategic management (e.g., Fiss, 2011;Greckhamer et al., 2008;Stokke, 2007), inter-organizational alliances (e.g., Leischnig et al., 2013), tourism management (e.g., Woodside et al., 2011), socially responsible practices (e.g., Crilly et al., 2012), and labor relations (e.g., Coverdill et al., 1994).

CCT835	"A complex solution makes no simplifying assumptions. As a result, if the researcher considers a large number of causal antecedent conditions, the derived solution will be fairly complicated. The parsimonious solution uses the remainders (i.e., combinations of the antecedent conditions not observed in the dataset) to simplify the solution. With such a strong assumption, the parsimonious solution should only be used if the assumptions are fully justified. Finally, the intermediate solution distinguishes between ""easy"" and ""strong"" assumptions and takes into consideration only the ""easy"" remainders when simplifying the solution. Thus, the complex solution, which makes no assumptions, is the most appropriate; prior research highly recommends this solution especially when the number of causal antecedent conditions is not large (Elliott, 2013;#CITATION_TAG & Sonnett, 2005)."	5	"The parsimonious solution uses the remainders (i.e., combinations of the antecedent conditions not observed in the dataset) to simplify the solution.

CCT836	This study contributes to the literature in two ways. First, from a methodological perspective, the study demonstrates the value of complex combinatorial fsQCA and the advantages of this technique over traditional correlational methods; that is, fsQCA enables examination of different configurations of conditions that give rise to an outcome of interest (#CITATION_TAG & Hecker, 2013;Stanko & Olleros, 2013). Second, from a theoretical perspective, the study builds and expands on the findings of SL by showing that alternative routes to CSR skepticism and its outcomes likely occur, in addition to those SL present. Overall, the aim is to estimate the alternative complex antecedent conditions (or causal recipes) that lead to high membership in four outcome conditions: (1) CSR consumer skepticism, (2) retailer equity, (3) resilience to negative information about the retailer, and (4) WOM. The value of this study lies in the effort to describe combinatorial complexities assuming asymmetrical relationships between variables, rather than symmetrical net effects that multiple regression analysis (MRA) and SEM usually estimate.	5	This study contributes to the literature in two ways.

CCT837	"The need for alternative techniques 3.1. Focus on the ""net effect"" estimation Multiple regression equations follow a net effects estimation approach (i.e., estimation of the effect size of each independent variable on the dependent variable, after controlling for the impact of the other independent variables also included in the equation). However, multicollinearity (i.e., significant correlations among the independent variables) is common, especially in cases with a large number of independent variables (e.g., Mittal et al., 1998;Wittink & Bayer, 1994). If multicollinearity is high, the regression estimator becomes inefficient and may yield statistically non-significant estimates or estimates inconsistent with the supposed associations (e.g., Van der Meer et al., 2005). Even in cases of low multicollinearity, the estimated net effects of the independent variables may change from significant to non-significant depending on the additional independent variables that enter the equation (Woodside, 2013). #CITATION_TAG (2012) posits that researchers who use regression analysis falsely assume that by entering variables into the equation, they somehow control for these variables. However, adding variables in non-experimental studies does not mean controlling for them because predictors usually co-vary with each other."	5	However, multicollinearity (i.e., significant correlations among the independent variables) is common, especially in cases with a large number of independent variables (e.g., Mittal et al., 1998;Wittink & Bayer, 1994).

Their results also provide support for the hypotheses that CSR skepticism results in lower levels of consumer-based retailer equity, decreased consumer resistance to negative information about the retailer, and unfavorable word of mouth (WOM).	0	Using structural equation modeling (SEM), #CITATION_TAG and Leonidou (2013) (hereinafter SL) find that attributions of egoistic-and stakeholder-driven motives provoke consumer skepticism about corporate social responsibility (CSR) while values-driven attributions alleviate skepticism.

CCT850	"The need for alternative techniques 3.1. Focus on the ""net effect"" estimation Multiple regression equations follow a net effects estimation approach (i.e., estimation of the effect size of each independent variable on the dependent variable, after controlling for the impact of the other independent variables also included in the equation). However, multicollinearity (i.e., significant correlations among the independent variables) is common, especially in cases with a large number of independent variables (e.g., Mittal et al., 1998;Wittink & Bayer, 1994). If multicollinearity is high, the regression estimator becomes inefficient and may yield statistically non-significant estimates or estimates inconsistent with the supposed associations (e.g., #CITATION_TAG et al., 2005). Even in cases of low multicollinearity, the estimated net effects of the independent variables may change from significant to non-significant depending on the additional independent variables that enter the equation (Woodside, 2013). Armstrong (2012) posits that researchers who use regression analysis falsely assume that by entering variables into the equation, they somehow control for these variables.

CCT854	In general, fsQCA is an analysis of set relationships. A set can be a group of elements or, in the case of fsQCA, a group of values. The main aim of the technique is to identify all necessary and sufficient conditions that lead to a specific outcome condition (#CITATION_TAG, 1999). Necessary conditions are those that produce the outcome. All cases (e.g., individuals) that display the outcome also display the necessary condition; however, necessary conditions by themselves are not always enough to produce the outcome. Sufficient conditions are those that always lead to the given outcome; however, they may not be the only conditions that lead to this outcome, because several alternative sufficient conditions may co-exist. In set notation, the outcome set is a subset of the necessary condition set, and this sufficient condition set is a subset of the outcome set (Ragin, 2008).	5	In general, fsQCA is an analysis of set relationships.

CCT855	The majority of fsQCA applications are in political science and sociology. Representative contributions from various sub-fields include policy analysis (e.g., Blake & Adolino, 2001), political parties (e.g., Gordin, 2001), social and political change (e.g., Berg-Schlosser & De Meur, 1994), social movements (e.g., Nomiya, 2001), welfare states (e.g., Peillon, 1996), law and criminology (e.g., Tarohmaru, 2001), linguistics (e.g., Mendel & Korjani, 2012), psychology (e.g., Theuns, 1994), and addictive behavior (e.g., Eng & Woodside, 2012). Applications of the technique in business and management are fewer, though representative examples are available in areas such as international business (e.g., Pajunen, 2008;Schneider et al., 2010), innovation (e.g., Cheng et al., 2013;Ganter & Hecker, 2013;Stanko & Olleros, 2013), organizational behavior and strategic management (e.g., Fiss, 2011;Greckhamer et al., 2008;Stokke, 2007), inter-organizational alliances (e.g., Leischnig et al., 2013), tourism management (e.g., Woodside et al., 2011), socially responsible practices (e.g., Crilly et al., 2012), and labor relations (e.g., Coverdill et al., 1994). Ragin (2000) was the first to introduce fsQCA; this technique differs from regression-based methods and other conventional statistical techniques in important ways (#CITATION_TAG & Goertz, 2006;Pajunen, 2008). For example, in contrast with correlational techniques, which attempt to estimate the net effect of an independent variable on an outcome variable, fsQCA attempts to identify the conditions that lead to a given outcome (Schneider et al., 2010). As such, fsQCA is a proficient tool that helps supplement traditional correlational analyses in three main ways: (1) asymmetry (i.e., the relationships between independent and dependent variables are treated as not symmetric), ( 2) equifinality (i.e., multiple pathways and solutions lead to the same outcome), and (3) causal complexity (i.e., combinations of causal antecedent conditions lead to the outcome, and thus the researcher focuses not on the estimation of independent net effects but on the estimation of combinatorial effects) (Elliott, 2013).	5	The majority of fsQCA applications are in political science and sociology.

CCT877	The posterior densities of φ gta and π g for g = 1, 2 when G = 2 and g = 1, 2, 3 when G = 3 when {t = 10, a = 1}, {t = 10, a = 10} and {t = 20, a = 1} are shown in Fig. 3. The areas of high density suggest two very distinct groups: a large group, with population fraction ≈80 % and low retention probability, and a small group, with population fraction ≈20 % with very high retention probability. The areas of lower density when G = 3 suggest that the third group, that connects the two groups, has medium retention probability. These results are consistent with the predicted differences in migration strategies of male and female sandpipers; males may spend less time than females at stopover sites in order to reach the breeding sites earlier (Bishop et al. 2004(Bishop et al. , 2006. Given the relative abundance of the retention groups in our study, this interpretation suggests a male-biased sex ratio in the stopover population. Alternatively, the heterogeneity in retention probability may reflect local movements of birds during a period of searching and settling that often occurs immediately after arrival to a stopover area (Alerstam and Lindström 1990). The group with low retention probability may be comprised of recent arrivals that were captured during a period of searching the landscape for favourable foraging conditions, but which ultimately settled outside the study area. The smaller group with high retention probability may be comprised of birds that settled and remained in the study area during stopover. Local movements may occur in response to changing conditions in prey abundance or water depth, facilitated by wetland connectivity (#CITATION_TAG and Parent 1997;Obernuefemann et al. 2013).	0	Alternatively, the heterogeneity in retention probability may reflect local movements of birds during a period of searching and settling that often occurs immediately after arrival to a stopover area (Alerstam and Lindström 1990).

Stopover sites provide an essential opportunity for migrating birds to break their journey, rest and refuel. It is important to assess the significance of a site, an attribute which is based on the number of migrants that use it and the duration of their stopover, as this can aid in formulating conservation strategies aimed at non-breeding habitat for migrant shorebirds (Brown et al. 2001) and in measuring the effects of management treatments (Nichols and Williams 2006;Lyons et al. 2008)."	2	"The data set of semipalmated sandpipers was first analysed in Matechou et al.

CCT884	"It is widely accepted that we have no direct control over what we believe. Indeed, it is sometimes argued that the opposite claim-that beliefs can be acquired at will-is not only false, but incoherent in some way (see e.g. O""Shaughnessy (1980, Vol. 1, pp. 21-28) Williams (1973). Now it is undeniable that some beliefs are passively acquired. One has only to think of beliefs that derive from perception, memory and simple inferential processes. Yet there is a long tradition of thinking that we have the power to decide what attitude to take towards a proposition, through an act of deliberate judgement. (Indeed, many philosophers would have identified what I have been calling occurrent beliefs with acts of deliberate judgement.) Aspects of commonsense mentalistic discourse also lend support to such a view. We speak of trying to believe, of refusing to believe, of having a duty to believe, of needing to believe, and so on. These idioms are often dismissed as pointing, at most, to the possibility of indirectly inducing belief, by exposing oneself to belief-forming influences. But there is another commonsense idiom which suggests that we are capable of more than this. This is our talk of making up and changing our minds. We often refer to such episodes, and speak of them as free intentional actions (we urge the indecisive to make up their minds and blame the inconstant for changing them). Of course, sometimes, when we speak of a person having made up their mind, we mean that they have made a decision to do something-that they have formed an intention, not a belief. But this does not exhaust the idiom. We also speak of making up or changing our minds about matters of fact-about the truth of a theory, say, or the safety of a course of action, or the honesty of a politician (see #CITATION_TAG (1979)). That is to say, we allow that some doxastic attitudes can be objects of decision. And since not all such attitudes are formed in this way, this again points to a bifurcation in our notion of belief."	1	We often refer to such episodes, and speak of them as free intentional actions (we urge the indecisive to make up their minds and blame the inconstant for changing them).

CCT885	"Now in this Dennett is following the majority of acceptance theorists. Acceptance is usually thought of as an intellectual attitude, motivated by narrowly cognitive ends (more precisely, by a desire to maximize cognitive utility-that is, to assert maximally true and comprehensive theories). So scientists may, after due investigation, decide to accept a theory as true for the purposes of future research, and may categorically assert its truth in their writings. But, theorists claim, this should have no influence on how they act outside the context of enquiry: as Maher insists, the decision to accept a theory should not affect one""s willingness to act as if it is true in practical contexts (Maher, 1993, p. 150) [12]. The reason for this is simple. The fact that you have accepted a proposition does not make it more probable, and should, therefore, not make you more confident of its truth (excepting cases of self-fulfilling prophecies, such as ""I won\""t get to sleep tonight""). Nor, in most cases, will it alter your practical utilities (deliberation is about achieving one""s ends, not about changing them). So if the rational action to choose is the one determined, in Bayesian fashion, by one""s assignments of confidence and utility, then acceptance should not alter a rational person""s choices. To allow it to do so is, for the Bayesian, to lapse into irrationality. As the remark quoted above indicates, Dennett takes a similar view: one""s opinions may predict one""s behaviour, but they do not actively guide it. Now if opinion were an attitude which manifested itself only in the context of academic inquiry, then this would be unobjectionable. But that is not Dennett""s view. For he identifies opinion formation with making up of mind and occurrent belief. And these seem, on the face of it, to have immense practical influence. We can make up our minds about mundane matters, such as whether beef is safe to eat, the salesman trustworthy, or the weather threatening enough to justify taking an umbrella. And such decisions have significant behavioural consequences. If I make up my mind that eating beef is unsafe, then it is natural to suppose that this will affect, not only what I say, but what I eat. The same goes for occurrent belief. We entertain all manner of occurrent thoughts, and they seem to have a profound effect on what we do (recall my occurrent belief about the roadworks, which caused me to take a different route to work). So there is a tension here. On the one hand, Dennett wants to deny that opinions have a direct role in the guidance of action; on the other, he wants to identify them with conscious occurrent beliefs-episodes which do have such a role.

CCT886	Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a distinct form of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characterized by the balanced translocation t(15;17)(q24;q21) that results in production of the PML-RARA oncogene. Retinoid-based therapy in combination with either anthracyclines or arsenic trioxide results in favorable rates of complete remission and overall survival, provided that the patient can be supportively managed through the initial coagulopathy [1]. However, a small proportion of patients harbor variant translocations that result in fusion of RARA to one of a number of alternative partner genes [2,3]. The most often reported of these variant translocations is the t(11;17)(q23;q21) which results in the fusion of the zinc finger gene ZBTB16 (formerly PLZF) to the RARA locus [4,5]. The bone marrow morphology of patients with ZBTB16-RARA APL tends to be distinct from those patients with either classical or the hypogranular variant of APL #CITATION_TAG. Identification of the ZBTB16-RARA fusion is critical for therapeutic purposes as these patients are generally resistant to differentiating retinoid therapy, specifically alltrans retinoic acid (ATRA) [7], and treatment should be with standard AML regimens according to current recommendations [8].	0	Retinoid-based therapy in combination with either anthracyclines or arsenic trioxide results in favorable rates of complete remission and overall survival, provided that the patient can be supportively managed through the initial coagulopathy [1].

CCT888	In murine models of APL, induction of PML-RARA expression in myeloid stem cells results in a myeloproliferative disease that subsequently develops into leukemia with promyelocytic features after a relatively long latency implicating the requirement for further cooperating mutations to fully recapitulate the APL phenotype [#CITATION_TAG,10]. The development and application of whole exome sequencing and targeted exome sequencing have led to the identification of several cooperating mutations in APL and demonstrates the clonal and subclonal acquisition of mutational events in conjunction with the driver PML-RARA oncogene [11,12]. A similar pattern of these cooperative mutations appears to exist within patients with APL and those with other types of AML [13]. Whether these additional mutations have a prognostic impact is unclear [14]. However, identification of these mutations may allow targeted intervention [15]. To date, the pattern of cooperating mutations in patients with ZBTB16-RARA APL has not been investigated. Characterization of a patient with this uncommon cytogenetic variant of APL is described with subsequent application of a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach to identify allied mutational events.	0	In murine models of APL, induction of PML-RARA expression in myeloid stem cells results in a myeloproliferative disease that subsequently develops into leukemia with promyelocytic features after a relatively long latency implicating the requirement for further cooperating mutations to fully recapitulate the APL phenotype [#CITATION_TAG,10].

CCT890	The authors of this review both enjoy international collaboration and started working together almost 20 years ago when they discovered that they have a common concern for persons with advanced dementia. The collaboration started by sharing scales that can be used for research in population. Initially, U.S. discomfort and dementia staging scales were used in Dutch studies that investigated treatment of pneumonia [1][2][3]. The Dutch translation of these scales was evaluated and additional work assessed a cut off for severe dementia [4] and the staging of the items [5] and the Dutch investigators also evaluated a new U.S. set of scales for dementia at the end of life [6]. Recent work developed also from sharing newly collected [3] and existing data #CITATION_TAG-the Dutch author analyzing the U.S. data and vice versa. Where previous work focused on pneumonia, newer work was on modifiable factors that are increasing risk of behavioral symptoms of dementia [7]. The common theme in this research was concern for quality of life of person with advanced dementia that could be supported by palliative care, as summarized in recent work defining domains and recommendations for palliative in dementia [8].	0	The collaboration started by sharing scales that can be used for research in population.

CCT891	We first provide measures for assessment of global goals of palliative care in dementia; quality of life and absence of discomfort [8]. We also discuss assessment of engagement that is important for quality of life. The most important symptoms at the end of life with dementia are pain, shortness of breath, and behavioral symptoms [#CITATION_TAG,12]. We discuss measures for each of these symptoms, and regarding behaviors, we include social behaviors when discussing rejection of care and engagement. We conclude with satisfaction with care in the form of a family evaluation of care which is an important outcome at the end of life on its own [13].	0	We first provide measures for assessment of global goals of palliative care in dementia; quality of life and absence of discomfort [8].

CCT892	Detection and diagnosis of pain in residents with advanced dementia is one of the most important factors in their total care. Nurses may feel highly uncertain about pain in residents with dementia who could not report if they were in pain [37]. Patients with advanced dementia are less likely to have the ability to respond to pain scales, necessitating the use of observational scales in up to about half of patients (31%; [38]; 53%; [39]). More than half of residents who were dying with advanced dementia experienced pain in the last week of life that was not satisfactorily managed [#CITATION_TAG,41]. The prevalence of pain increases to 80% if rare pain is included [11].	0	Detection and diagnosis of pain in residents with advanced dementia is one of the most important factors in their total care.

CCT894	Unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most common and disabling medical conditions. Many epidemiological studies have demonstrated the high prevalence of MDD in the general population. For example, the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) recently reported a one-year prevalence rate of 4.5% for MDD, indicating that over 1.2 million Canadians suffer significant distress and impairment in functioning due to mood disorders #CITATION_TAG.

CCT895	Given the high prevalence of MDD, increasing attention is now being paid to the economic costs of depression. The economic burden is, in part, attributable to individuals with depression being unable to work, or absenteeism. For example, one study reported that workers with MDD missed an average of 32 days of work in a 12-month assessment period #CITATION_TAG, while another found that about 30% of work disability claims in Canada were attributed to mental illness, predominant depression, and other mood disorders [6]. However, the greater proportion of the total economic burden of MDD lies in reduced productivity, or presenteeism, in which the depressed individual remains in the work setting but with productivity suffering both in quality and quantity [7,8].

CCT898	These results are generally consistent with those from other studies that have examined the effect of individual depressive symptoms on work productivity. In contrast to our study, in which patients self-reported the degree of work impairment from individual symptoms, other studies correlated scores from patient-rated scales of symptom severity with scales assessing work productivity. For example, Sanderson and colleagues [10] studied a nonclinical sample of 431 employees at 10 Australian call centres and examined depressive symptoms endorsed on a rating scale (the Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9) and effects on work productivity, as measured by the work limitations questionnaire (WLQ) [11,#CITATION_TAG]. Three symptoms (tired or little energy, little interest or pleasure, and psychomotor disturbance) were found to be significant predictors for presenteeism, while symptoms of low mood, sleep disturbance, and appetite disturbance were not predictive of work impairment.

CCT902	This study has a number of limitations, including the use of a cross-sectional design, the self-report nature of the data without objective assessment of occupational performance, the varied nature of work experienced by respondents, and the use of multiple and varied medication regimens by the patients. We also did not have information on whether patients were engaged in psychosocial treatments (e.g., cognitive behavioural therapy) that may affect work functioning. Nonetheless, there is clear clinical relevance to our findings. First, since numerous depressive symptoms are perceived by patients to be associated with work impairment, occupational functioning should be routinely assessed (via standardized, validated assessment scales) in the management of people who are clinically depressed. Second, treatment for MDD in working patients should address the symptoms that interfere most with work functioning, including anergia, tension, and concentration difficulty. Monitoring of symptoms and functioning during treatment is also important, to ensure that work functioning returns to premorbid status and is not affected by residual symptoms of depression. Finally, since the side effect profiles for individual antidepressants are quite different #CITATION_TAG, the choice of medication for working patients should take into account those side effects that most impair work functioning. Antidepressants that minimize these side effects (daytime sedation, insomnia, headache, and anxiety/agitation) should be the preferred options for working patients with MDD.	0	First, since numerous depressive symptoms are perceived by patients to be associated with work impairment, occupational functioning should be routinely assessed (via standardized, validated assessment scales) in the management of people who are clinically depressed.

CCT912	It is assumed that the detection of CTCs is associated with cancer, based on the finding that CTCs can be detected in all major cancers and not in healthy subjects or those with benign disease #CITATION_TAG. Most of the assays are based on enrichment and subsequent identification of CTCs using monoclonal antibodies directed against epithelial epitopes, for example, the transmembrane glycoprotein epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) or cytokeratins that are expressed on both normal and malignant cells. This widely based approach is based on the fact that blood cells usually lack detectable expression of epithelial markers, being of mesenchymal origin. What remains to be confirmed is whether or not trafficking of normal epithelial cells could occur in certain benign conditions and might contribute to false positive findings in the current assay methods unless unambiguous criteria for the malignant nature of the marker positive cells are used.	0	It is assumed that the detection of CTCs is associated with cancer, based on the finding that CTCs can be detected in all major cancers and not in healthy subjects or those with benign disease #CITATION_TAG.

CCT913	Although the first report on circulating tumors was published by Ashworth in 1869 #CITATION_TAG, the lack of technology precluded further investigations on their clinical use until recently. Developments in immunological and quantitative real-time PCR-based analysis have enabled the detection, enumeration and characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). The monitoring of CTCs has the potential to improve therapeutic management at an early stage and also to identify patients with increased risk of tumor progression or recurrence before the onset of clinically detected metastasis. Furthermore, the molecular profiling of CTCs can provide new insights into cancer biology and systemic treatment in neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings.	0	Although the first report on circulating tumors was published by Ashworth in 1869 #CITATION_TAG, the lack of technology precluded further investigations on their clinical use until recently.

CCT928	Millimeter-wave communication systems using narrow beams at the transmitter and receiver, which suppress the interference of neighboring beams. The narrow beam also strongly reduces the angular spread of the incoming waves and the multipath components of millimeter waves to be limited. Therefore, by having the beam forming, beam-forming weights can be adjusted to a desired area or location #CITATION_TAG. There are two types of beam forming technology. The first one is fixed beam forming and another is adaptive beam forming [3]. Adaptive beam forming forms effective beams by adapting beam width and beam direction depending on the surrounding state of radio channels. It requires high hardware complexity and needs extra feedback mechanism for beam forming. While in fixed beam forming, beams with a fixed direction and width are generated. Therefore, switched beam forming is introduced as it is simpler and lesser operation system than adaptive beam forming. The concepts of beam steering or beam shifting are developed for scanning array antennas. Scanning array antennas were developed initially for aircraft, maritime and aeronautical applications. In terms of practical implementation, various technologies such as GPS, radiofrequency identification (RFID), tracking, traffic control and collision avoidance radars and wireless local area network (W-LAN), have been employed in developing the indoor localization and scanning systems [4].	5	Millimeter-wave communication systems using narrow beams at the transmitter and receiver, which suppress the interference of neighboring beams.

CCT937	Figure 5 shows simulated far-field for four different designed antennas. It can be seen that there is no beam shifting in Antenna (a) and Antenna (d) as there is no phase shift difference between two radiating patches. However, the main beam of the Antenna (b) and Antenna (c) have shifted by 15˚. This is because the two radiating patch elements radiate at different rate due to the existence of phase shift difference. As a summary, manipulating the electrical length of the feeders can provide a phase difference between two patches of antennas.

CCT938	For decades, people have endeavored to develop pioneering techniques for secret communication. In fact, Cryptography and Steganography are two popular techniques intended to protect and safely transmit secret data. The former scrambles information so that it becomes unreadable by unauthorized parties; whereas, the latter conceals the very existence of information by embedding it into a carrier medium such as image, audio file, video file, or text file #CITATION_TAG. In this respect, steganography can be considered as a stealthy method for secret communication as it hides the existence of communication, so much so that no one apart from the sender and the receiver would suspect any piece of data being communicated. Fundamentally, steganography is an information hiding technology that covers data into digital media files. Its applications are diverse, including secret communication, copyright protection, digital watermarking, and tamper proofing [2]. In practice, steganography works as follows: A message that needs to be secretly communicated is first encoded into a digital carrier file such as an image file. Then, the carrier is transmitted to the intended recipient, who upon reception, decodes it and eventually recovers the covered secret message. Obviously, the biggest advantage of steganography is that it hides the fact that a secret communication is taking place; thus, avoiding the detection of the secret message by eavesdroppers and malicious parties [3]. The strength of steganography resides in how strong the carrier medium is imperceptible and how much the covered message is difficult to be detected and uncovered by unauthorized observers. In critical situations, people known as steganalysts are hired to identify suspicious files and detect whether or not they contain secret information, and if possible, recover this information. Actually, developing a steganography algorithm that firmly conceals data in a hard-to-notice, hard-to-detect, and hard-to-recover way ensures that the secret information being communicated through certain carrier medium would pass undetected by forensics and illicit third parties. This paper proposes a novel steganography scheme for hiding digital data into uncompressed image files using a randomized algorithm. The proposed scheme uses two mediums to deliver the secret data. The first medium is a carrier image holding the secret data inside the LSBs of its pixels which, unlike traditional LSB techniques, these pixels are selected randomly and not in sequence. The second medium is a well-structured and syntactically correct English text made up of several English sentences pointing to the location of the random carrier pixels, that is, the location of the secret data in the carrier image. In effect, the second medium is not predefined but dynamically generated during the encoding process using a mini-version context-free grammar of the English language coupled with a lexicon of English words randomly categorized in 10 categories representing the 10 digits of the decimal system. These digits are used to generate all possible location values for the carrier pixels. The proposed scheme has such advantages as being hard-to-notice, hard-to-detect, hard-to-recover, binary-based, multilingual, and mutable. All in all, they enable it to be used for versatile types of data, in total secrecy, and without getting detected or recovered, tricking stego-analysts and misleading them from the true location of the covert data.	0	For decades, people have endeavored to develop pioneering techniques for secret communication.

CCT944	The proposed scheme is designed to work on 24-bit True Color uncompressed digital images such as BMP. Basically, the pixels of a 24-bit BMP image are each composed of three 8-bit color components, namely R, G, and B components #CITATION_TAG. The proposed scheme hides the secret data into the three LSBs of each of these color components; thus, the hiding capacity is equal to 9 bits out of 24 bits or 37% of the total size of the carrier image (9/24=0.375=37%). The carrier image is manipulated as a 2D plane geometric object composed of a finite set of points along with their coordinates. These coordinates effectively indicate the locations of the pixels in the carrier image itself. Figure 1 depicts a BMP image as a geometric 2D plane as regarded by the proposed scheme. In effect, the proposed scheme does not hide the secret data sequentially into the carrier pixels; instead, it randomly selects pixels to carry in the secret data. Thus, shuffling and dispersing the secret data over the carrier image in a random manner. The actual positions of these randomly selected carrier pixels, which interchangeably are their coordinates, are mimicked by an English text composed of English sentences that are grammatically well structured. The English text is generated using a context-free grammar and a lexicon of words organized into 10 categories from category 0 till category 9. Words that constitute the English sentences are selected from these categories based on the coordinates of the carrier pixels. For instance, coordinates (019,421) are encoded by selecting a word from category 0, a word from category 1, a word from category 9, a word from category 4, a word from category 2, and a word from category 1 respectively. Actually, every coordinate (i.e. pixel location) is represented by an English sentence. As a result, multiple pixels would result in multiple sentences which eventually result in a complete English text. The context-free grammar is essential in order to generate a grammatically correct text, for instance, generating a sentence composed of a determinant, followed by a noun, followed by verb, followed by a preposition. It is worth noting that no common words exit between the categories of the lexicon as it would be later impossible to recover the real coordinates of the carrier pixels out the English text. Finally, together, the carrier image and the generated English text are sent to the receiver who has to use the same algorithm, the same grammar, and the same lexicon to recover the different locations of the carrier pixels and consequently the secret data.	5	The proposed scheme is designed to work on 24-bit True Color uncompressed digital images such as BMP.

Figure 2 outlines the production rules of the CFG used by the proposed scheme. On the other hand, the lexicon of the CFG which is outlined in Table 1 is organized into 10 categories each of which contains a set of terminal words that belong to the English language. It is worth mentioning that no common words exist between the categories of the lexicon as it would be later impossible to recover the real coordinates of the carrier pixels out of the English text. Every word in the above categories uniquely encodes the category to which it belongs. For instance, the word ""this"" encodes the digit ""0"" exclusively because it belongs to category 0. The word ""Harvard"" encodes the digit ""9"" exclusively because it belongs to category 9, and so forth.

CCT946	"So far, massive research work has been conducted in the development of steganography for digital images. One of the earliest techniques is the LSB technique which obscures data communication by inserting the secret data into the insignificant parts of the pixels of an image file, more particularly, into the least significant bits (LSB) [5]. The modified version of the image, which is called carrier file or stego file, is then sent to the receiver through a public channel. The foremost requirement of the LSB technique is that it should not exhibit any visual signs in the carrier image so as to not give any indications that secret data are being communicated covertly. Basically, the LSB technique is an insertion-based image steganography method that embeds secret data into uncompressed computer image files such as BMP and TIFF. In this technique, the data to hide are first converted into a series of bytes, then into a series of smaller chunks each of which is of size n bits. Then, n LSBs of the pixels of the carrier image are replaced by each of the chunks of the original data to hide. The ultimate result of this operation is a carrier image carrying the secret data into the LSBs of its pixels. As the color values that are determined by LSBs are insignificant to the naked eye, it is hard to tell the difference between the original image and the tampered one, taking into consideration that no more than a certain number of LSBs were used to conceal the secret data; Otherwise, visual artifacts and damages would be produced in the carrier image which would in turn draw suspicions and raise attention about something unusual in the carrier image. For instance, in 24-bit True Color BMP images, using more than three LSBs per color component to hide data may result in perceptible artifacts in the carrier image [6]. As an illustration for the LSB technique, let""s say that the letter H needs to be hidden into an 8-bit grayscale bitmap image. The ASCII representation for letter H is 72 in decimal or 01001000 in binary. Assuming that the letter H is divided into four chunks each of 2 bits, then four pixels are needed to totally hide the letter H. Moreover, assuming that four consecutive pixels are selected from the original image whose grayscale values are denoted by P 1 =11011000, P 2 =00110110, P 3 =11001111, and P 4 =10100011, then substituting every two LSBs in every of these four pixels by a 2-bit chunk of the letter H, would result in a new set of pixels denoted by P 1 = 11011001, P 2 =00110100, P 3 =11001110, and P 4 =10100000. Despite changing the actual grayscale values of the pixels, this has little impact on the visual appearance of the carrier image because characteristically, the Human Visual System (HVS) cannot differentiate between two images whose color values in the high frequency spectrum are marginally unalike #CITATION_TAG."	0	"As an illustration for the LSB technique, let""s say that the letter H needs to be hidden into an 8-bit grayscale bitmap image.

CCT947	"So far, massive research work has been conducted in the development of steganography for digital images. One of the earliest techniques is the LSB technique which obscures data communication by inserting the secret data into the insignificant parts of the pixels of an image file, more particularly, into the least significant bits (LSB) [5]. The modified version of the image, which is called carrier file or stego file, is then sent to the receiver through a public channel. The foremost requirement of the LSB technique is that it should not exhibit any visual signs in the carrier image so as to not give any indications that secret data are being communicated covertly. Basically, the LSB technique is an insertion-based image steganography method that embeds secret data into uncompressed computer image files such as BMP and TIFF. In this technique, the data to hide are first converted into a series of bytes, then into a series of smaller chunks each of which is of size n bits. Then, n LSBs of the pixels of the carrier image are replaced by each of the chunks of the original data to hide. The ultimate result of this operation is a carrier image carrying the secret data into the LSBs of its pixels. As the color values that are determined by LSBs are insignificant to the naked eye, it is hard to tell the difference between the original image and the tampered one, taking into consideration that no more than a certain number of LSBs were used to conceal the secret data; Otherwise, visual artifacts and damages would be produced in the carrier image which would in turn draw suspicions and raise attention about something unusual in the carrier image.

CCT949	In order to successfully accomplish this task, the musician must perform and monitor multiple features of the performance, such as melody, harmony, rhythm, dynamics, articulation, and the playing of other musicians in the ensemble, simultaneously. Attending to all of these concurrent musical features is no easy task (#CITATION_TAG, 2001). Studies of divided attention show that performance decreases when attention must be divided amongst multiple tasks at once, especially when they are processed by similar mental resources (e.g., Klapp, 1979;Navon & Gopher, 1979;Pashler, 1994;Wickens, 2002).

Less research has been done in areas where the creative product is produced in real time. In music, the distinction is exemplified by composition and improvisation. A three-minute composition may take hours or days to create whereas a three-minute musical improvisation is created in exactly three minutes. In both areas the creative product is typically shaped by style, including frameworks for tonal and rhythmic structures. However, in improvisation it is necessary to produce this output very rapidly; in group improvisation, the musician may also need to attend to multiple external sources and shape the note choices accordingly.	0	REATIVITY RESEARCH IS TYPICALLY FOCUSED on creative processes and products conceived without time constraints (#CITATION_TAG, Grigorenko, & Singer, 2004).

For example, narratives are to entertain, recount to share experience, anecdote to share a reaction, exemplums to share moral judgments, and observations to share a personal response to things or events. The stages commonly identified in these genres are started optionally with an Orientation stage introducing an expectant activity and a Coda at the end of the story.

CCT965	"On a microscopic scale (e.g. chloroplasts), the CO 2 ""compensation point CO 2 (Farquhar et al., 1980), defines the equilibrium between CO 2 uptake by photosynthesis and release by photorespiration. In plants (e.g. in soil in a bell jar: Tolbert et al., 1995), the CO 2 compensation point is the CO 2 concentration at which net CO 2 fixation is zero. On the global scale (Berry et al., 1994), this is the CO 2 level for which the total CO 2 evolution (dark respiration) by all living organisms is equilibrated by carboxylation by plants. As carbon dioxide re-supply from the external environment (either from the air or dissolved gases in seawater which in turn have equilibrated with the air) is generally not limiting, this suggests a fundamental molecular control on the macroscopic CO 2 content in the air lying in the biochemistry of rubisco catalysis. If the external environment lies on the wrong side of the compensation barrier limit, net plant and algal growth ceases. If CO 2 is too low, organisms cannot capture carbon. O 2 and CO 2 are interlinked, with linear co-variance (Tolbert et al., 1995, but see André 2011a. Tolbert et al. (1995) postulated an O 2 compensation point CO 2 , defined as the upper limit of O 2 at a given CO 2 level, above which plants cannot have positive carbon uptake. On a planetary scale, this is the equilibrium point where O 2 production to atmosphere by all green plants (including both higher plants and also microbial oxygenesis) equals the consumption by all living biosystems consuming O 2 by dark respiration. The Tolbert et al. (1995) experimental data rather paradoxically implied the linkage of CO 2 to O 2 was disconnected from the linkage of O 2 to CO 2 . The experimental results of Tolbert et al. (1995) led #CITATION_TAG (2008) to propose the existence of a ""prohibited region"" in O 2 :CO 2 space, where oxygen partial pressure would be so high that plant growth would stop, and eventually the plant would respire itself to death. However, André (2011a, b) re-investigated the high-O 2 prohibited zone hypothesis, invalidating it by showing that the Tolbert et al. (1995) experiments, on which it was based, may have been affected by problems such as leakage artefacts."	1	"O 2 and CO 2 are interlinked, with linear co-variance (Tolbert et al., 1995, but see André 2011a.

CCT966	Winter (December, January, February -DJF) wind regimes over Israel by self-organizing maps (SOM) were previously defined (Berkovic, 2017). This study extends this ability to other seasons. Therefore, some of the sections of Berkovic (2017) are repeated here for clarity. The climate in Israel is a Mediterranean climate, with a hot and dry summer, transitional seasons and rainy winter. Since the summer regime is well known it was omitted from the study. During the summer there is a single synoptic group (Persian trough) with a typical wind regime exhibiting diurnal veering according to the diurnal heating and topography (Skibin and Hod, 1979;Ziv et al., 2004). During the winter and the transitional seasons synoptic variability increases and therefore, a higher number of surface wind regimes prevail. Many previous studies referred to a subjective or semi-objective synoptic classification (Alpert et al., 2004); however, there is a need for an automatic objective classification when studying the surface winds on an hourly time scale. An automatic algorithm will greatly facilitate the definition of wind regimes or synoptic classes, since a subjective analysis is highly tedious. This study shows the ability of SOM to automatically reconstruct previous subjective studies (#CITATION_TAG et al., 1998;Levy et al., 2008;Ziv and Yair, 1994;Goldreich, 2003) characterizing the surface flow over Israel. SOM (self-organizing maps, Hewitson and Crane, 2002;Liu et al., 2006;Liu and Weisberg, 2011) is an objective non-linear clustering technique extensively used to determine the patterns of meteorological variables, e.g., sea surface temperature, wind, or geopotential height. This study employed SOM to define surface wind regimes over Israel at 12:00 UTC during winter, spring and autumn. The wind patterns are derived from surface wind measurements. Wind regimes at other synoptic hours (00:00, 06:00, 18:00 UTC) are not shown here for the sake of brevity. The relation between surface wind patterns and synoptic conditions is clarified by calculating the averages of the synoptic variables according to the SOM classification. The synoptic variables were derived from ECMWF ERA-INTERIM reanalysis data.	1	During the winter and the transitional seasons synoptic variability increases and therefore, a higher number of surface wind regimes prevail.

An exception is the apparent preferential use of organo-ferric colloids by bacteria, whereby the removed color comes from iron, not DOC (Oleinikova et al., 2017).

CCT975	"Rubisco I may have evolved in cyanobacteria nearly 3 Ga ago (Nisbet et al., 2007), yet rubisco\""s ""specificity"" (its preference for CO 2 over O 2 ) remains paradoxically restricted. In contrast with other enzymes, rubisco seems inefficient, with a sluggish reaction rate (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2006). However, rubisco\""s ""inefficiency"" may be deceptive. On a molecular level, analysis of the kinetics and isotopic fractionation of rubisco I in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms (Tcherkez et al., 2006) suggests that evolution has led to a near-perfect compromise between catalytic turnover and CO 2 :O 2 specificity (Gutteridge and Pierce, 2006). Organisms that that are adapted to higher CO 2 :O 2 ratios contain rubisco with higher catalytic rates and lower specificity. In contrast, a rubisco enzyme with a higher specificity (i.e. more able to select for CO 2 at low CO 2 :O 2 ratios) will operate only at lower temperatures and lower rates (Tcherkez et al., 2006), and will thus suit organisms adapted to a different range of habitats on the climatically varied planet. In each photosynthetic species, the rubisco enzymes may be nearly optimally fitted to their specific tasks, each exquisitely tuned to the local environment (Tcherkez et al., 2006;Gutteridge and Pierce, 2006) under a globally mixed atmosphere."	2	"Rubisco I may have evolved in cyanobacteria nearly 3 Ga ago (Nisbet et al., 2007), yet rubisco\""s ""specificity"" (its preference for CO 2 over O 2 ) remains paradoxically restricted. In contrast with other enzymes, rubisco seems inefficient, with a sluggish reaction rate (#CITATION_TAG et al., 2006). However, rubisco\""s ""inefficiency"" may be deceptive. On a molecular level, analysis of the kinetics and isotopic fractionation of rubisco I in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms (Tcherkez et al., 2006) suggests that evolution has led to a near-perfect compromise between catalytic turnover and CO 2 :O 2 specificity (Gutteridge and Pierce, 2006). Organisms that that are adapted to higher CO 2 :O 2 ratios contain rubisco with higher catalytic rates and lower specificity."	n
CCT976	Over time, the Sun has steadily warmed (Gough et al., 1981) with significant consequences for life on Earth (Sagan and Chyba, 1997;Goldblatt et al., 2009;Nisbet and Nisbet, 2008;Ueno et al., 2009;#CITATION_TAG et al., 2010; see also Fig. 8.1 in Kasting, 2008). It might be expected that, under the faint young Sun, the Hadean and Archaean Earth would have been covered in ice (see Nisbet and Sleep, 2001;Nisbet and Fowler, 2004). If the oceans are cool now, in a modern world subject to repeated ice ages, then billions of years ago under a faint Sun, the planet ought to have existed in deep permafrost, too cold for life except near volcanic vents. However, the evidence in Jack Hills zircons in Western Australia that implies the presence of liquid water oceans 4.3 Ga ago (Wilde et al., 2001), and the presence of sedimentary rocks in the 3.8 Ga old Isua belt (Rosing, 1999), both imply that surface temperatures permitted liquid water. High concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases, either CO 2 or perhaps methane, could have prevented the oceans from freezing over.	2	Over time, the Sun has steadily warmed (Gough et al., 1981) with significant consequences for life on Earth (Sagan and Chyba, 1997;Goldblatt et al., 2009;Nisbet and Nisbet, 2008;Ueno et al., 2009;#CITATION_TAG et al., 2010; see also Fig. 8.1 in Kasting, 2008).

CCT977	As the Earth has evolved, the continental area may have changed over time (but see discussion in #CITATION_TAG and Nisbet, 2012). Moreover, as the potential temperature of the mantle has cooled, thickening lithosphere may have became more capable of supporting mountains and hence more erosion of silicates taking up CO 2 . Thus, there may be purely inorganic feedbacks capable of changing and managing the greenhouse over time as the external inputs varied. Zeebe and Caldeira (2008) demonstrated a close mass balance of carbon cycle fluxes in the late Pleistocene, which they interpreted as evidence for control by the weathering feedback.	2	As the Earth has evolved, the continental area may have changed over time (but see discussion in #CITATION_TAG and Nisbet, 2012).

CCT982	In this paper, to overcome the limitations of the aforementioned results we study the admission problem for the MOdel-based SElf-adaptation of SOA systems (MOSES) service broker we proposed in [#CITATION_TAG,7], which manages a composite service offering differentiated QoS service classes. We formulate the optimal admission control problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem with the goal to maximise the broker discounted expected infinite horizon reward while guaranteeing non-functional QoS requirements to its users. Our results show the MDP-based admission control always guarantees significantly higher average rewards than the blind policy. We also considered finite horizon policies which are computationally more efficient than the infinite horizon counterpart and that allow us to tradeoff optimality with computational complexity/timehorizon length. Our findings show that even with the simple 1-step horizon policy it is possible to achieve better results with respect to the blind policy, quite close to the infinite horizon optimum, but at a fraction of the computational cost.	2	In this paper, to overcome the limitations of the aforementioned results we study the admission problem for the MOdel-based SElf-adaptation of SOA systems (MOSES) service broker we proposed in [#CITATION_TAG,7], which manages a composite service offering differentiated QoS service classes.

CCT983	"Phytophagous (plant-eating) insects are tremendously diverse-constituting perhaps as much as one third of all animal species (Strong et al. 1984)-and their speciation has been tied to extrinsic reproductive barriers arising during changes in host plant use (Bush 1969;Wood and Keese 1990;Berlocher 1998;Nason et al. 2002;Funk et al. 2011). Many insects find mates on or near the female""s oviposition substrate (the host plant), so emergent preferences for novel hosts may often translate into assortative mating and behaviorally isolate different host-associated populations (e.g., Emelianov et al. 2001;Berlocher and Feder 2002). The result is the formation of partially isolated races, presumed to be an early step along the so-called """"speciation continuum"""" (Mallet 2008). Genetically differentiated races within morphologically defined species have also been found to coexist on a single plant species, particularly among taxa that have recently undergone adaptive radiations (Marsteller et al. 2009;Stireman et al. 2012). Further, recent empirical and theoretical work demonstrating that populations can diverge even in the face of effective migration (#CITATION_TAG 2008;Nosil and Feder 2012), as well as new information about the permeability of genomes to between-lineage gene flow (Turner et al. 1999;Michel et al. 2010;Gompert et al. 2010) both suggest that persistent hybridization between closely related lineages may occur without leading to lineage fusion or breakdown of reproductive barriers.

CCT984	In most phospholipids, the fatty acid at the sn-1 position is palmitic (16:0), stearic (18:0) or oleic acid (18:1) while either a saturated, unsaturated or a polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can be found at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone. In certain classes and subclasses found in cells or tissues, PUFAs are the major fatty acids at the sn-2 position. This distribution gives rise to subclasses of lipids that are targeted for the release of PUFAs and the generation of specific lipid mediators and signaling molecules. An example is 1-alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine, the precursor of platelet activating factor and leukotrienes [77,122]. The incorporation of PUFAs into phospholipid subclasses is highly choreographed such that most PUFAs are initially incorporated into 1,2-diacyl phospholipids subclasses before they are remodeled into the ether-linked phospholipids classes by coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent or CoA-independent transacylase activities [#CITATION_TAG,84,126,165,167].	3	In certain classes and subclasses found in cells or tissues, PUFAs are the major fatty acids at the sn-2 position.

CCT985	"(iv) Gestural Interaction Is Not an ""Add-On. The previous lessons made it clear that gestural interaction is not simply an additional input mode that can be added to an existing application. The direct mapping of mouse actions to hand gestures proved problematic due to technical limitations but also due to ergonomic considerations. Even if we had used the Leap Motion it would not have been clear whether users would have yielded higher performance or higher levels of satisfaction. Thus the game controls in the gestural mode should be redesigned to cope with the limited accuracy and to minimize fatigue and discomfort. For example, the second arm might be used for certain controls in order to provide more balance to body movements. Instead of point-andclick actions, the goal-crossing paradigm #CITATION_TAG could be used. Furthermore, when selecting the home square, only the target squares that constitute valid moves could be highlighted and enabled for selection. Goal-crossing might also benefit players with motor impairments. Highlighting and enabling only valid squares might benefit novices."	3	Even if we had used the Leap Motion it would not have been clear whether users would have yielded higher performance or higher levels of satisfaction.

CCT987	Molecular dynamics (MD) is widely used to investigate function of biomolecular systems with large size and long time scales. Biomolecular complexes con-sisting of components such as proteins, lipids, DNA and RNA, and solvent are typically large in simulation terms. The explosive growth in interest in investigating inherently complex biomolecular systems such as solvated protein complexes leads to molecular systems with tens to hundreds of thousands of atoms, as for example in [39]. Parallel algorithms are critical to the application and progress of MD in order to 1) improve the accuracy of simulation models, 2) extend the length of simulations, and 3) simulate large, complex systems. Numerous MD parallelizations have been described in the literature, ranging from the easy to implement replicated algorithm [6,20] to the more difficult to implement spatial decomposition [#CITATION_TAG,30], which is generally more scalable. The force decomposition algorithm is an intermediate approach in that it is generally more efficient than the replicated algorithm and easier to implement than the spatial decomposition [27].	0	Biomolecular complexes con-sisting of components such as proteins, lipids, DNA and RNA, and solvent are typically large in simulation terms.

In addition, experimenting with MD algorithms on novel parallel architectures is facilitated by tools aiding the parallelization process. Various tools have been applied to molecular dynamics simulations with varying success. Data parallel approaches have been found to be problematic due to the irregularity inherent to molecular dynamics [38], which is compounded by unstructured legacy applications [7]. Low-level tools such as MPI have been successful for performance [27], but do compromise readability and consequently maintenance after the development period. Many good tools have been developed for problems structured similarly to molecular dynamics, but often target regularly structured applications, for example [12].	0	The ease of implementation of an MD algorithm is important given the need for multiple algorithms to address the variability encountered in mapping molecular dynamics algorithms onto parallel architectures [#CITATION_TAG,9].

CCT994	Patient and technique survival are some of the most important indices in the assessment of the substitutive therapies; in our study, the comparison between both groups did not show statistical differences. Similar findings were observed by Zhang and coworkers [10]. Residual renal function plays an important role in the solute clearance and in fluids balance in the dialysis population; Heaf et al. inferred that preservation of the RRF in peritoneal dialysis could be a cause of better survival in the first 2 years of dialysis treatment regarding HD [38]. Some studies support that the diminution of urine volume is a predictor of technique failure and a cause of mortality [39][40][41][42]. In contrast, in the NECOSAD study, the authors considered anuric peritoneal dialysis patients to have acceptable patient and technique survival, and the risk factors for death were the same as in the dialysis population as a whole [43]; similar conclusions were found in the EAPOS study in anuric patients on APD [44] and in anuric patients with high body surface area #CITATION_TAG. Lobo and coworkers performed a nationwide study of 739 patients but did not find any differences between survival rates between patients with and patients without previous haemodialysis or in anuric or residual renal function patients [46]. As expected in our study, many patients from the second group were anuric (65.7%); however, we also did not observe statistical differences on the very long term when comparing these anuric patients versusPDF patients (Figures 3 and 4).	1	Similar findings were observed by Zhang and coworkers [10].

CCT997	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancer forms worldwide. The chance of surviving colorectal cancer depends on the stage of the disease. One third of diagnosed colorectal cancer patients have locally advanced disease with one or more lymph nodes affected, indicating a worse prognosis. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin can increase overall survival for this patient group [1][2][3][4][5]. Oxaliplatin can cause acute and chronic neurotoxicity and can be an intolerable burden for these patients #CITATION_TAG[7][8]. The severity of neurotoxic side effects depends on the dosage and duration of the oxaliplatin dose rate. Dose reduction and complete discontinuation of therapy is common because of fear of debilitating and prolonged neurotoxicity [9,10].	3	The chance of surviving colorectal cancer depends on the stage of the disease.

CCT998	"The cancer disease itself had an impact on patients"" lives and they balanced the neurotoxic side effects against their survival. Expectation of a cure after completing treatment was a natural outcome and the patients looked forward to live as usual. These experiences were in agreement with results in other studies of cancer patients [21,22]. In the present study the patients expressed doubts three months after they had finished chemotherapy. After six months in the post-treatment phase the patients started to adapt to the neurotoxic side effects. One year after concluding chemotherapy the patients had learned to live with the neurotoxicity. These results showing the trajectory are not in agreement with any earlier studies. This could be due to our long term follow up. The post-treatment survivorship can be a distressed period of symptom burden, fatigue and reduced mental well-being [23,24].
